# LifeOS v2.0 - Complete System Guide

## System Overview

LifeOS v2.0 represents a complete integration of your original LifeOS structure with PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) methodology, creating a unified, actionable knowledge management system that transforms passive information storage into active life management.

### What Makes LifeOS v2.0 Different

1. **Action-Oriented Organization** - Every piece of information has a clear purpose and actionability
2. **PARA Integration** - Systematic categorization based on actionability rather than topics
3. **Unified Metadata** - Standardized YAML frontmatter across all content
4. **Template-Driven Consistency** - Standardized templates for all content types
5. **Cross-Reference Network** - Rich linking between all system components
6. **AI-Optimized Structure** - Designed for enhanced AI assistance and interaction

### Core Philosophy

**"From Information to Action"**
- **Projects** = Work with deadlines
- **Areas** = Ongoing responsibilities 
- **Resources** = Useful information for future use
- **Archives** = Completed or inactive content

```

### File Naming Standards

- **Kebab-case**: All words lowercase with hyphens
- **Numerical prefixes**: Two-digit numbers for ordering (01-, 02-, etc.)
- **Descriptive titles**: Clear, searchable names
- **Consistent extensions**: `.md` for markdown files

**Examples:**
- `01-life-os-web-application-development.md`
- `02-marriage-and-relationship.md`
- `03-note-template-enhanced.md`
- `00-project-master-index.md`

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Understand PARA Categories

#### Projects (01-Projects/)
**What belongs here:**
- Actionable work with specific deadlines
- Tasks that have clear start and end points
- Work that produces deliverables

**Examples:**
- "LifeOS Web Application Development"
- "College Financial Aid Research"
- "Kitchen Countertop Organization"

**How to use:**
1. Use for work that has a clear end date
2. Include specific goals and success criteria
3. Track progress and milestones
4. Archive when complete

#### Areas (02-Areas/)
**What belongs here:**
- Ongoing responsibilities and standards
- Life areas that require continuous attention
- Aspects of life that need maintenance

**Examples:**
- "Marriage and Relationship"
- "Home Organization"
- "Health and Fitness"

**How to use:**
1. Define minimum standards for each area
2. Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
3. Schedule regular reviews
4. Create supporting projects as needed

#### Resources (03-Resources/)
**What belongs here:**
- Useful information for future use
- Reference materials and knowledge
- Templates and tools

**Examples:**
- Template library
- Book recommendations
- Technical documentation
- Knowledge concepts

**How to use:**
1. Store information you may need later
2. Organize by accessibility and usage frequency
3. Link to relevant projects and areas
4. Regular review and cleanup

#### Archives (04-Archives/)
**What belongs here:**
- Completed projects
- Outdated information
- Historical content

**How to use:**
1. Automatic migration from other categories
2. Searchable for reference
3. Maintains system organization
4. Preserves historical context

### Step 2: Use Standardized Templates

#### Universal Templates
- **Enhanced Note Template** - General notes and concepts
- **Learning Template** - Educational content and courses
- **Creating Template** - Creative projects and work

#### PARA-Specific Templates
- **Project Template** - All actionable projects
- **Area Template** - Life areas and responsibilities
- **Routine Template** - Recurring processes and activities

#### Journal Templates
- **Daily Journal Template** - Daily reflection and planning
- **Weekly Journal Template** - Weekly review and planning

### Step 3: Implement Unified Frontmatter

Every file should include complete YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "[Descriptive Title]"
type: "[note|project|area|resource|journal|routine]"
category: "[projects|areas|resources|archives]"
status: "[Active|Completed|Paused|Archived]"
priority: "[High|Medium|Low|Critical]"
created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
last_modified: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags:
  - "tag1"
  - "tag2"
  - "tag3"
related_files:
  - "file-name"
related_areas:
  - "area-name"
next_action: "[Immediate next step]"
---
```

### Step 4: Create Cross-References

Use standardized linking syntax:
- `[[file-name]]` - Link to other files
- `[Display Text](path/to/file.md)` - External links
- Cross-reference between PARA categories actively

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (5-10 minutes)
1. **Review Dashboard** - Check project status and area health
2. **Set Daily Priority** - Identify ONE THING for the day
3. **Review Tasks** - Check projects and areas for actionable items
4. **Plan Connections** - Consider how today's work supports areas

### Throughout the Day
1. **Capture Quickly** - Add fleeting notes with minimal friction
2. **Process Regularly** - Move captured information to proper categories
3. **Update Status** - Keep project and area files current
4. **Link Actively** - Create connections between related content

### Evening Review (5-10 minutes)
1. **Progress Review** - Update project completion percentages
2. **Area Health Check** - Quick assessment of life areas
3. **Tomorrow Planning** - Set up next day's priorities
4. **Journal Entry** - Reflect on the day and capture insights

### Weekly Review (30-60 minutes)
1. **Project Review** - Assess progress and adjust timelines
2. **Area Review** - Check standards and KPIs
3. **Resource Cleanup** - Process and organize new information
4. **System Maintenance** - Update links, clean up files
