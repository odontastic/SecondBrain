# Project: Clean & Organize Kitchen Countertops

## Project Overview
Transform two kitchen countertops from cluttered surfaces into organized, functional workspaces. One serves as a desk area, the other as a general work space that has accumulated clutter.

## Project Scope

### Countertop 1: Desk Area
- [ ] Clear all items
- [ ] Sort into: keep, relocate, discard
- [ ] Clean surface thoroughly
- [ ] Organize kept items appropriately
- [ ] Establish clear workspace

### Countertop 2: Junk Area
- [ ] Clear all items
- [ ] Sort into: keep, relocate, discard
- [ ] Clean surface thoroughly
- [ ] Find proper homes for items (don't just relocate junk)
- [ ] Maintain clear space going forward

## Execution Plan

### Week 1: Systematic Clearing (Monday-Friday)
- **Monday:** Clear and sort both countertops
- **Tuesday:** Find homes for items, discard trash
- **Wednesday:** Deep clean surfaces
- **Thursday:** Final organization and system setup
- **Friday:** Verify completion, document system

## Organization Strategy

### Sorting Categories
- **Keep & Use:** Items that serve active functions
- **Relocate:** Items that belong elsewhere in the home
- **Discard:** Broken, expired, or unnecessary items
- **Donate:** Items in good condition but no longer needed

### Workspace Setup
- **Desk Countertop:** Essential work items only
- **Utility Countertop:** Frequently used cooking/prep items
- **Clear Zones:** Maintain specific areas free of items

## Success Criteria
- **Visual Clarity:** Both countertops appear organized and uncluttered
- **Functional Efficiency:** Easy access to regularly used items
- **System Maintenance:** Clear organization that prevents future clutter
- **Deep Clean:** Sanitized surfaces with proper maintenance routine

## Resources Needed
- Cleaning supplies (all-purpose cleaner, microfiber cloths)
- Storage containers (if needed for relocated items)
- Trash bags for disposal
- Organization bins or dividers (if required)

## Maintenance Plan
- **Daily:** Quick surface wipe-down
- **Weekly:** General tidying and reset
- **Monthly:** Deep clean and system evaluation
- **Quarterly:** Major organization review and adjustment

## Risk Factors
- **Attachment to Items:** Difficulty discarding or relocating possessions
- **Time Constraints:** Rushing may lead to incomplete organization
- **Storage Limitations:** May discover lack of proper storage spaces

## Long-term Benefits
- **Improved Workflow:** More efficient kitchen and workspace usage
- **Reduced Stress:** Visual calm and easier item location
- **Better Hygiene:** Regular cleaning becomes easier with clear surfaces
- **Property Value:** Well-maintained, organized home appearance

## Related Areas
- **Home Organization:** Overall household organization standards
- **Household Cleaning:** Maintenance and cleaning routines
