# Project: LifeOS Application Development

**Goal:** Create a complete LifeOS web application with dashboard, daily planning, PARA views, GTD task management, administration, and history tracking

**Target Completion Date:** [Ongoing development project]

**Status:** Planning & Initial Development

---

## Architecture Plan

### Technology Stack (Beginner-Friendly)
- **Backend:** Python + Flask (simple, powerful, works great on Linux)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (modern, clean UI)
- **Database:** SQLite (no server setup needed, file-based)
- **Data Source:** Existing markdown files + SQLite for dynamic data
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with responsive design

### Why This Stack?
- ✅ Python/Flask: Simple syntax, extensive documentation, runs on your Linux system
- ✅ SQLite: No database server needed, all data in one file
- ✅ File-based: Integrates with your existing markdown files
- ✅ FOSS: All open source tools
- ✅ Easy to modify: Python is readable and understandable

## Data Model

### SQLite Tables

1. **projects**
   - id, name, description, goal, target_date, status, created_at, updated_at

2. **areas**
   - id, name, description, status, standard, created_at, updated_at

3. **tasks**
   - id, title, description, project_id, area_id, context, priority, due_date, completed, created_at, completed_at

4. **daily_plans**
   - id, date, morning_plan, afternoon_plan, evening_plan, smit, faith_goal, energy_level, completed, created_at

5. **journal_entries**
   - id, date, type (daily/weekly/monthly), content, insights, created_at

6. **history_log**
   - id, date, type (action/thought/intention/insight), content, category, created_at

---

## File Integration Strategy

- **Read existing markdown files** from Projects/, Areas/, Resources/, Archives/
- **Parse markdown** to extract structure
- **Display in web interface**
- **Allow editing** through web interface, save back to markdown
- **Sync approach:** Web app reads markdown, can also write back

---

## UI/UX Design Principles

1. **Clean & Modern:**
   - Minimalist design
   - Plenty of white space
   - Clear typography
   - Consistent color scheme

2. **Easy at a Glance:**
   - Visual indicators (colors, icons)
   - Status badges
   - Progress bars
   - Quick stats

3. **Navigation:**
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Quick search

4. **Responsive:**
   - Works on desktop
   - Readable on tablet
