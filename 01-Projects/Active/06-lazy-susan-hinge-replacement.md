# Project: Replace Broken Lazy Susan Hinge

## Project Overview
Replace a broken lazy susan cabinet hinge with a functional substitute. The original hinge is no longer in production, requiring research to find compatible alternatives that maintain full rotation functionality.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Identification (Monday-Tuesday)
- [ ] Measure broken hinge dimensions
- [ ] Identify make/model of lazy susan cabinet
- [ ] Research alternative hinges that fit specifications
- [ ] Order replacement hinge (if shipping required, expedite)

### Phase 2: Installation (Wednesday-Friday)
- [ ] Remove old broken hinge
- [ ] Install new hinge
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Clean up installation area

## Technical Requirements

### Measurement Specifications
- **Width:** [Measure exact width of current hinge]
- **Height:** [Measure height of mounting area]
- **Depth:** [Measure projection from cabinet face]
- **Mounting Points:** [Number and spacing of screw holes]
- **Rotation Range:** [Required 270° or 360° rotation]

### Compatibility Criteria
- **Load Capacity:** Must support cabinet door weight
- **Mounting Pattern:** Must align with existing screw holes or adaptable
- **Rotation Functionality:** Must maintain smooth, full rotation
- **Material Quality:** Durable hardware that will last

## Research Strategy

### Online Resources
- **Hardware Store Websites:** Home Depot, Lowe's, Amazon
- **Cabinet Hardware Specialists:** Hafele, Blum, Accuride
- **Lazy Susan Specialists:** Companies specializing in rotating hardware
- **Forums and Reviews:** DIY and home improvement communities

### Search Terms
- "Lazy susan hinge replacement"
- "Cabinet rotating hardware"
- "[Brand name] lazy susan parts"
- "Discontinued cabinet hardware"
- "Universal lazy susan hinge"

## Installation Considerations

### Required Tools
- Screwdriver (Phillips and flathead)
- Drill (if new holes needed)
- Level (to ensure proper alignment)
- Measuring tape
- Pencil (for marking)

### Installation Steps
1. **Remove Cabinet Door:** Take door off existing hinge
2. **Remove Broken Hinge:** Unscrew and dispose of old hinge
3. **Prepare Mounting Surface:** Clean and check for damage
4. **Test Fit New Hinge:** Ensure proper alignment
5. **Install New Hinge:** Secure with appropriate screws
6. **Reinstall Door:** Hang door and test rotation
7. **Final Adjustment:** Fine-tune for smooth operation

## Quality Assurance

### Functionality Testing
- **Rotation:** Smooth 360° rotation without binding
- **Load Test:** Door remains stable when loaded
- **Alignment:** Door sits flush with cabinet frame
- **Durability:** No wobbling or loose movement

### Success Criteria
- **Immediate Functionality:** Cabinet operates normally after installation
- **Long-term Reliability:** Hinge performs consistently over time
- **Aesthetic Integration:** New hinge doesn't detract from cabinet appearance
- **Cost Effectiveness:** Solution is economical compared to cabinet replacement

## Risk Management
- **Shipping Delays:** Order early to ensure arrival by Thursday
- **Compatibility Issues:** Have backup options researched
- **Installation Difficulty:** Professional installation as contingency
- **Hinge Quality:** Choose reputable brands to avoid future failures

## Notes
- Original hinge no longer in production
- Need to find compatible substitute
- Must maintain full rotation functionality
- If shipping needed, order Monday to ensure arrival by Thursday
