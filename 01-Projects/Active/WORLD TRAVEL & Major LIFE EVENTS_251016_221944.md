KEYs to Longevity of the Blue Zones (Ikara/Greece, Okinawa/Japan,
Sardinia/Italy, Loma Linda/US, Nicoya/Costa Rica):

\- EAT WISELY: A balanced, plant-based diet (vegetables, nuts, grains)
in moderation

\- OUTLOOK: Purpose-ikigai, faith, stress free

\- CONNECT: community, volunteerism, family

\- MOVE NATURALLY: exercise, gardening, walking, by hand

Blue Zones diets:

1\) 4 spices for anti-inflammation

turmeric, black pepper, garlic, ginger

2\) 5 herbs: fennel, oregano, rosemary, cilantro, garlic

3\) Anti-inflammatory foods:

beans (ie.edamame), whole grains, sweet potatoes, tofu, olive oil,
tomatoes, fresh fruits, squash, leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables,
nuts and seeds

\*Dan Buettner - Blue Zone researcher

While researching for my book, "The Blue Zones of Happiness: Lessons
From the World's Happiest People," I spoke with Dan Witters, who has
been the Research Director of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being
Index since 2008, in an effort to figure out the hallmarks of the most
content communities.

Witters told me that authentic happiness emerges from a cluster of
interconnected factors that almost always appear in a pack. He
identified 15 of what he calls "cowbell" metrics that signal true
happiness.

**If you agree with these**

**statements, you are happier than most people**

You manage your finances well and live within your means. You have
enough money to do everything you want to do.

You set and reach goals on an ongoing basis.

You always make time for trips or vacations with family and friends.

You use your strengths to do what you do best every day.

You feel safe and secure in your community.

You learn something new or interesting every day.

You have someone in your life who

encourages you to be healthy.

You eat healthy every day.

You eat five servings of fruits and vegetables at least four days every
week.

You get to the dentist at least once per year.

In the last 12 months,** **you have received recognition for helping to
improve the city or area where you live.

You don't smoke.

You are of a normal, healthy weight. 

You exercise at least 30 minutes at least three days per week.

You are active and productive every day.

The writer E.B. White said, "I arise in the morning torn between a
desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor)
the world. This makes it hard to plan the day." The key is to find that
sweet spot between savoring life now and doing things that lead to a
richer, more meaningful outcome in the future.

MEDITERRANEAN DIET:

\- he simply began to popularize a way of eating and enjoying food that
people in the Mediterranean had been following for centuries. "The
biggest tenets of that are seafood; lean proteins in the form of beans,
nuts, and seeds; whole grains; ancient grains; fermented dairy; fruits,"
says Feller. "And then alcohol is consumed in moderation."

Great news, folks: With the Mediterranean diet, it's a very "you do you"
approach to healthy eating. That being said, the Mediterranean lifestyle
does encourage you

to load your plate with particular foods and food groups.

**Fresh fruits and vegetables:** According to Cleveland Clinic, you
should have at least one serving of veg per meal.

**Seafood:** The Mediterranean diet emphasizes seafood and poultry
protein sources; fish in particular, is a great source of heart-healthy
omega-3s.

**Healthy fats and oils:** Extra-virgin olive oil is touted as the Med
diet's hero, but Berghoff says that other oils, such as walnut and pecan
oil, are also rich in healthy polyphenols.

**Legumes:** Pulses and legumes like lentils, beans, chickpeas, and peas
are great sources of protein, fiber, and healthy fatty acids---and the
Med diet encourages you to eat them multiple times a week.

**Nuts, seeds, and grains:** Whether you're eating 'em as a snack,
sprinkling them on your salads, or making a bowl of whole-grain cereal,
add in nuts.

**Fermented dairy:** While the Med diet recommends reducing your overall
dairy intake to once a day, Feller says that folks in the Mediterranean
reap the gut-healthy benefits of fermented dairy like yogurt and goat
cheese.

According to Berghoff, many of the Mediterranean diet's health benefits
stem from the ways this eating style reduces inflammation within the
body. On the one hand, you're cutting back on foods that are known to
cause inflammation, such as high-sugar foods, highly processed foods,
red meats, and alcohol, she says. On the other, you're increasing the
amount of inflammation-reducing foods you're eating, including plants,
omega-3 fatty acids, and monounsaturated

fats (largely from olive oil).

BOOK SUMMARY - \"Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity\" by Peter
Attia, M.D.

\- It\'s not about lifespan but HEALTHSPAN, how to live longer and live
better in your later years (the \"Marginal Decade\")

\- The 4 diseases that most people die from or the 4 Horsemen: heart
disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (ie. Alzheimers,
Parkinsons), and metabolic dysfunction (diabetes)

\- The KEY is PREVENTION earlier in life

\- 5 tools for prevention: EXERCISE, nutrition (plant based, nuts, low
carbs, good poly/monounsaturated fats), sleep (6-8 hrs a night),
emotional health, and medicine

I. EXERCISE: aerobic, strength and stability

\- AEROBIC conditioning:

1\) Zone 2 endurance training - four 45-mins sessions a week with steady
pace where you can still talk (ie. treadmill or stationary bike);

2\) VO2 max - hard push/run for 4 mins then jog 4 mins easy where heart
rate drops below 100/min. Repeat this 4-6 times and cool down

\- STRENGTH training: proteins, load-bearing activities, hormone
replacement therapy (HRT), drugs to increase bone density as indicated.
Grip strength; ability to carry heavy stuffs and put them down
(concentric/eccentric loading); pulling motions; hip-hinging movements
(strengthen legs, flutes, lower back)

\- STABILITY training: strong, fluid, flexible, agile. Dynamic
neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) and Postural Restoration Institute
(PRI). Focus on breathing, feet firmly planted on ground, balance,
protect the spine is the goal. Neuromuscular control.

II\. NUTRITION: biochemistry - scientifically rigorous, highly
personalized and driven by

feedback and data. Focus on: nourishment, muscles, metabolic health.
Goal is to reduce energy intake while adding lean mass. So, consume
fewer calories, increase protein intake, pair with proper exercise. 3
methods: caloric restriction (CR), dietary restriction, time restriction
(intermittent fasting). From long-term monkey research, 4 conclusions -
avoiding diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction important to
Longevity, strong link between calories and cancer, the QUALITY of food
is as important as the quantity, if your diet is already high quality
and you are metabolically healthy then only a slight degree of caloric
restriction can still be beneficial. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
combined with other biomarkers (lean mass, lipids, uric acid, insulin,
liver enzymes, ApoB and Lp(a) levels). DEXA scan can measure bone
density and muscle mass. For proteins, need 4 servings a day: protein
shake protein snack, 2 protein meals). Protein is very IMPORTANT.
Fats-saturated and poly/monounsaturated are good. Polyunsaturated

fats or PUFA are either omega-6 (corn, soybean) or omega-3s (marine like
fish with EPA/DHA and non-marine like nuts and flaxseed). But, MUFA or
monounsaturated are probably best (olive oil). So, recommended diet:
olive oil, avocado, nuts, salmon, anchovies. Fasting over long periods
forces the body to mobilize fat stores and turns down mTOR, the
pro-growth and pro-aging pathway.

III\. SLEEP: at least 7 1/2 hrs each night. Sleep deprivation can cause
insulin resistance, increase risk of cardiovascular disease, and
impaired cognitive health (risk of Alzheimers and dementia). High stress
level can make us sleep poorly activating the sympathetic response and
metabolic dysfunction. REM sleep is the dream stage and important for
creativity, problem solving, procedural memory, process emotional
memories, maintain emotional awareness. Deep NREM sleep for long-term
memory consolidation in

the hippocampus and brain cleanup (ie. clearing out amyloid beta and
tau, the 2 proteins found in Alzheimers pts). Sleep meds like Ambien or
benzodiazepines induce unconsciousness without improving sleep quality.
Exception is trazodone at low dose can improve sleep architecture (also
the supplement ashwagandha). Best validated sleep questionnaire is the
Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (also, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and
the Insomnia Severity Index). Rule out sleep apnea with STOP-BANG
questionnaire or sleep study.

Tips for better sleep: room darkness, limit LED light exposure 2 hrs
before bed, limit cellphone or computer use, cool bedroom (65F), warm
bath before bed, no alcohol or caffeine, exercise during the day, avoid
stressful thoughts, meditation, avoid foods within 3 hrs of bedtime.
Goal is to do whatever increases \"sleep pressure.\"

IV\. EMOTIONAL HEALTH: the way we regulate our emotions and manage
interpersonal

relationships

\- Perhaps the most important of all

\- Some people have emotional trauma as a child. Some of these kids grow
up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults: 1) various addictions,
2) co-dependency or excessive psychological reliance on another person,
3) habituated survival strategies (anger, rage), 4) attachment
disorders.

\- Tools: 1) Reframing events and experiences, 2) mindfulness
meditation, 3) dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to help those who are
suicidal or at risk of self-harm; aimed at breaking the chain reaction
of negative stimulus -\> negative emotion -\> negative thought -\>
negative reaction. DBT has 4 pillars joined by one overarching theme
(mindfulness): emotional regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal
effectiveness, self management.

\- David Brooks\' \"The Road to Character\" book talks about \"resume
virtues\" like degrees and jobs versus \"eulogy virtues\" (what our
family/friends will remember us by)

BOTTOM LINE: Know your \"why\"

\- Why do you want to Outlive or pursue Longevity if you\'re not happy?

\- Need clarity, purpose, and meaning

\- \"I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future. If
you want to find someone\'s true age, listen to them. If they talk about
the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did,
they\'ve gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their
aspirations, what they\'re looking forward to\-\--they\'re young.\"

Thank you everyone for all your birthday wishes! I feel tremendous love
❤️ For my 42nd birthday this year, I got myself a Bentley and yet
another trip to a beautiful and special place to celebrate. I have been
lucky and intentional in going to special and beautiful places for my
birthdays :) This year it\'s Athens/Mykonos/Santorini/Istanbul and in
the past, my husband and I celebrated my birthdays in Singapore/Bali and
Dubai/Maldives. I like the combination of big historical cities with
beautiful island resorts :) I will continue to measure my life by the
5F\'s (Faith, Family, Friends, Fitness, Finance) and to always strive to
give back the 3T\'s: Time, Talent, and Treasure)\...

My early 42nd birthday present this year: a Bentley! I guess I have
officially joined the \"club\" as an average Rolls-Royce owner has 7
cars in his/her garage. My dream garage now has a collection of Ferrari,
Bentley, Rolls-Royce, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, and Tesla (my oldest one).
Looking back when we were growing up, my brother and I used to think how
amazing it would be to wake up in the morning and drive a different car
everyday\...well, he is no longer with us but I have made our dream a
reality! I have always been a crazy car lover and still remember the
first car I ever bought with my own money, a titanium silver 2004 BMW
325Ci convertible, after college\...my parents still kept the car in
immaculate condition until we finally sold it last year, which was 18
years later! However, no matter how crazy I am about cars, I have

not forgotten to invest smartly to become financially independent,
allowing me to cut down to part-time work (Tues-Wed-Thursday only) this
year to do more travel, volunteer work, and go out of town on my long
weekends as well as spend more time with our boys, Matthew and
John\...Thanks be to God!

Big 40th birthday Facebook REFLECTION:

https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid034TRZKFpz1Axm3CE2zqH5w4boS9wHeg4HJDgk7eWyNNPFTZV53zLPxa7yJajQ24mEl&id=1657009919&mibextid=Nif5oz

As I reach midlife with my big 40th birthday (by the average US life
expectancy), I think back at 18 years old what I had envisioned my life
to be in the future. I gave my high school valedictorian speech urging
my fellow graduates to strive for greatness by quoting

President John F. Kennedy, \"Ask not what your country can do for you;
ask what you can do for your country.\"

By any standards the journey to 40 has been an extraordinary ride,
achieving many of my dreams and financial freedom (as a car lover, the
Ferrari for my 40th birthday is just a marker of this milestone). With
my relentless pursuit of excellence and endless thirst for knowledge, I
have obtained 2 doctoral degrees, an MBA, and on my way to completing my
3rd doctorate next year in organizational change and leadership. Going
to Harvard for my M.D. was a once in a lifetime opportunity as well as
completing my surgery training at the #1 hospital in the country! All
done while raising 2 healthy, handsome, and intelligent boys with the
unwavering support of husband. I\'m truly humbled by the many blessings
God has bestowed on me. But, as I always remind myself, \"To whom much
is given, much is expected.\" I constantly strive for greater

impact everyday and I\'m grateful for the opportunity to inspire
countless others and empower them to seek their own greatness and to
join me in changing the world, one person at a time. As Mother Teresa
once said, \"You don\'t have to go to Calcutta to make a difference.
Find your own Calcutta wherever you are.\"

Beyond money, titles, degrees, fame, power, pleasure, and honor, deep
down what human beings seek are: someone to love, something to do, and
something to look forward to. The Japanese call this \"ikigai,\" a
reason for being or your purpose/your why.

In the next 40 years, I aim to give even more of the 3 T\'s back to the
world: Time, Talent, and Treasure. Glory to God!

My 44th BIRTHDAY REFLECTION:

Jesus Christ is risen, Alleluia ✝️ 🙏 Happy Easter! What a double
blessing it is since my 44th birthday this year falls on Easter! I
always keep in mind the idea of \"memento mori\" or \"remember we all
will die\" to remind myself that life on earth is a pilgrimage and that
death is a certainty\...however, Jesus has defeated death to give me
hope for eternal life if I live life in the here and now with purpose
and focus on building up treasures in heaven\...all the honors, degrees,
houses, cars, etc. are just transient happiness and not eternal bliss. I
happen to share my birthday with Queen Elizabeth II and in my birth year
of 1981 the Association of Women Surgeons was founded (what a
coincidence). The call to greatness was there from the very beginning
and I have always lived with that in mind in everything I do. But, no
matter what, the greatest challenge for greatness is to answer God\'s
call to become a saint because only saints go to heaven\...So, on this
Easter and my birthday, I thank God for his many blessings, especially
the gifts of life and faith.

May I persevere in faith until the very end when He calls me
home\...just as He just called our beloved Pope Francis home. I will
forever remember Pope Francis every year on my birthday (since after all
my younger son John\'s middle name is \"Francis\" and he was born in
2013, the same year Pope Francis became pope)\...May he rest in peace 🙏
✝️

\"Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine
upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.\"

world\...Let Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament speak to your hearts. It is

God with us. Seek Him without tiring, welcome Him without reserve, love
Him without interruption: today, tomorrow, forever.\" - St. Pope John
Paul II

BOOK SUMMARY for \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" by Clayton
Christensen

\"Success in life is not solely about achieving professional goals or
accumulating wealth.

It\'s about finding personal happiness, maintaining good relationships,
and living with integrity. It\'s important to have a clear sense of
purpose and to align your actions with your values.

Life is a delicate balance of personal and professional commitments.
It\'s crucial to invest time and energy in your relationships and
personal growth, just as you would in your career. The most fulfilling
lives are those that are filled with meaningful relationships and
activities, not just professional achievements.

It\'s also essential to maintain your integrity and stay true to your
moral compass. Compromising your values for short-term gains can lead to
long-term dissatisfaction and regret.

Remember, your life\'s measure is not in material possessions, but in
the lives you\'ve touched, the love you\'ve shared, and the

values you\'ve upheld.

In the end, it\'s not about how much you\'ve achieved, but who you\'ve
become as a person. So, strive to live a life that you can be proud of,
a life that truly reflects who you are and what you believe in.\"
