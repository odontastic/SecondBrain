## Technical Considerations

- **Developer:** Appropriate strength developer
- **Tools:** Application brushes, mixing bowls, timer
- **Aftercare:** Color-safe shampoo, conditioning treatments

## Risk Management
- **Color Fading:** May need to wait for current colors to fade further
- **Application Complexity:** Consider professional consultation if DIY proves challenging
- **Time Constraints:** Allow extra time if fading period needed
- **Results Variation:** Hair type and current condition may affect outcome

## Resources
