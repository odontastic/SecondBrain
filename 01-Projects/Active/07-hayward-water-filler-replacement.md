# Hayward Automatic Water Filler Float Replacement

## Project Overview
Procurement and replacement of Hayward automatic water filler float units (2 units required) to maintain proper pool water level automation and prevent manual water level monitoring.

## Project Goals
- [ ] **Parts Identification**: Look up Hayward model and obtain correct part number
- [ ] **Compatibility Verification**: Ensure part compatibility with existing pool system
- [ ] **Parts Procurement**: Order 2 replacement float units
- [ ] **Installation Planning**: Prepare for installation process
- [ ] **Quality Installation**: Install replacement floats properly
- [ ] **System Testing**: Verify proper water level automation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Record installation details and part numbers

## Current Status
**Phase**: Parts Identification  
**Progress**: 0% Complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Active

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate (by Nov 15, 2025)**:
   - Identify Hayward water filler model and part number
   - Research compatibility with current pool system
   - Obtain specifications and ordering information

2. **Procurement (by Nov 20, 2025)**:
   - Source parts from authorized Hayward dealer
   - Place order for 2 replacement float units
   - Confirm delivery timeline

3. **Installation Preparation (by Nov 22, 2025)**:
   - Prepare installation tools and workspace
   - Plan for pool downtime (if required)
   - Review installation instructions

4. **Installation (by Nov 25, 2025)**:
   - Install replacement float units
   - Test water level automation
   - Verify proper operation
