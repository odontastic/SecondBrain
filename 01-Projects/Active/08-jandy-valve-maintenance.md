# Jandy Valve Gasket Replacement

## Project Overview
Procurement and replacement of Jandy valve gasket to repair identified leak in the pool system. This is a critical repair to prevent water loss and potential system damage.

## Project Goals
- [ ] **Valve Inspection**: Physical inspection of Jandy valve and identification of gasket location
- [ ] **Parts Identification**: Locate correct Jandy valve gasket part number
- [ ] **Compatibility Verification**: Ensure gasket compatibility with existing valve
- [ ] **Parts Procurement**: Order replacement gasket
- [ ] **Valve Repair**: Remove old gasket and install new gasket
- [ ] **Leak Testing**: Verify leak has been resolved
- [ ] **System Operation**: Ensure proper valve operation after repair

## Current Status
**Phase**: Parts Identification  
**Progress**: 0% Complete  
**Priority**: High (Emergency)  
**Status**: Active

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate (by Nov 13, 2025)**:
   - Inspect Jandy valve physically
   - Identify gasket location and size
   - Document valve model and specifications

2. **Parts Sourcing (by Nov 15, 2025)**:
   - Research correct Jandy valve gasket part number
   - Source parts from authorized Jandy dealer
   - Place order for replacement gasket

3. **Repair Execution (by Nov 18, 2025)**:
   - Prepare repair area and isolate valve
   - Remove old gasket carefully
   - Install new gasket properly
   - Test valve operation

4. **Verification (by Nov 20, 2025)**:
   - Test for leaks under pressure
   - Verify valve operates correctly
   - Document repair completion

## Technical Requirements
- **Valve Type**: Jandy pool valve
- **Gasket Type**: Replacement valve gasket (specific part number TBD)
- **Tools Required**: Basic pool maintenance tools, gasket installation tools
- **Safety**: Pool system isolation may be required

## Current Issue
**Problem**: Leak identified at Jandy valve  
**Impact**: Water loss and potential system damage  
**Urgency**: High - requires immediate attention  
**Status**: 0% resolved

## Resources Required
- Jandy valve specifications and part numbers
- Authorized Jandy dealer contact information
- Installation tools and gasket installation equipment
- Pool system operation manual

## Emergency Status
This is a **HIGH PRIORITY EMERGENCY REPAIR** due to:
- Active water leak causing water loss
- Risk of system damage if not addressed promptly
- Potential for increased water costs
- Pool system efficiency impact

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Part Availability**: Contact multiple suppliers if needed
- **Installation Difficulty**: Review installation procedures carefully
- **System Downtime**: Plan repair during optimal time
- **Additional Leaks**: Complete diagnostic inspection to identify all issues

## Budget Considerations
- **Estimated Gasket Cost**: To be determined after inspection
- **Installation Time**: Approximately 1-2 hours
- **Tools Required**: Standard pool maintenance and valve tools

## Success Criteria
- [x] Valve and leak location identified
- [x] Correct gasket part number obtained
- [x] Replacement gasket ordered and received
- [ ] Old gasket removed successfully
- [x] New gasket installed properly
- [x] Leak resolved and tested
- [x] Valve operates normally
- [x] Repair documented

## Notes
- Critical priority repair due to active water leak
- Coordinate with pump leak diagnosis for comprehensive repair
- Ensure all work is documented for future reference
- Consider preventive maintenance on other valve seals
