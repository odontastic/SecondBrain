**Four Pillars:**
1. **EAT WISELY:** Balanced, plant-based diet (vegetables, nuts, grains) in moderation
2. **OUTLOOK:** Purpose (ikigai), faith, stress-free living
3. **CONNECT:** Community, volunteerism, family
4. **MOVE NATURALLY:** Exercise, gardening, walking, working by hand

### Blue Zones Diet Components

**4 Anti-Inflammatory Spices:**

- Fresh fruits
- Squash
- Leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables
- Nuts and seeds

*Source: Dan Buettner - Blue Zone researcher*

### Mediterranean Diet Principles

**Core Components:**
- **Fresh fruits and vegetables:** At least one serving of veg per meal
- **Seafood:** Emphasize fish for heart-healthy omega-3s; also poultry
- **Healthy fats and oils:** Extra-virgin olive oil (hero ingredient), walnut oil, pecan oil
- **Legumes:** Lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas (multiple times per week)
- **Nuts, seeds, and grains:** Whole-grain cereals, as snacks, on salads
- **Fermented dairy:** Yogurt and goat cheese (once daily) for gut health

**Benefits:**
- Reduces inflammation by cutting high-sugar foods, highly processed foods, red meats, and alcohol
- Increases inflammation-reducing foods: plants, omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fats

### "Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity" by Peter Attia, M.D.

**Key Concept:** Not about lifespan but HEALTHSPAN - how to live longer and live better in later years (the "Marginal Decade")

**The 4 Horsemen (Diseases Most People Die From):**
1. Heart disease
2. Cancer
3. Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)
4. Metabolic dysfunction (diabetes)

**THE KEY:** PREVENTION earlier in life

**5 Tools for Prevention:**

#### I. EXERCISE: Aerobic, Strength, and Stability

**Aerobic Conditioning:**
1. **Zone 2 Endurance Training:** Four 45-minute sessions per week at steady pace where you can still talk (treadmill or stationary bike)
2. **VO2 Max:** Hard push/run for 4 minutes, then jog 4 minutes easy where heart rate drops below 100/min. Repeat 4-6 times and cool down

**Strength Training:**
- Protein intake
- Load-bearing activities
- Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
- Drugs to increase bone density as indicated
- Focus on: Grip strength, ability to carry and put down heavy items (concentric/eccentric loading), pulling motions, hip-hinging movements (strengthen legs, glutes, lower back)

**Stability Training:**
- Strong, fluid, flexible, agile
- Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS)
- Postural Restoration Institute (PRI)
- Focus on: breathing, feet firmly planted, balance, spine protection
- Goal: Neuromuscular control

#### II. NUTRITION

**Approach:** Biochemistry - scientifically rigorous, highly personalized, driven by feedback and data

**Focus Areas:**
- Nourishment
- Muscles
- Metabolic health

**Goal:** Reduce energy intake while adding lean mass (consume fewer calories, increase protein intake, pair with proper exercise)

**3 Methods:**
1. Caloric restriction (CR)
2. Dietary restriction
3. Time restriction (intermittent fasting)

**Key Findings from Long-Term Monkey Research:**
1. Avoiding diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction important to longevity
2. Strong link between calories and cancer
3. Quality of food as important as quantity
4. If diet already high quality and metabolically healthy, only slight degree of caloric restriction can still be beneficial

**Monitoring Tools:**
- Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
- Biomarkers: lean mass, lipids, uric acid, insulin, liver enzymes, ApoB and Lp(a) levels
- DEXA scan: measure bone density and muscle mass

**Protein:** VERY IMPORTANT
- Need 4 servings daily: protein shake, protein snack, 2 protein meals

**Fats:**
- **Saturated and polyunsaturated:** Good
- **PUFA (Polyunsaturated):** Omega-6 (corn, soybean) or omega-3s (marine like fish with EPA/DHA; non-marine like nuts and flaxseed)
- **MUFA (Monounsaturated):** Probably best (olive oil)

**Recommended Diet:**
- Olive oil
- Avocado
- Nuts
- Salmon
- Anchovies

**Fasting Benefits:**
- Forces body to mobilize fat stores
- Turns down mTOR (pro-growth and pro-aging pathway)

#### III. SLEEP

**Requirement:** At least 7.5 hours each night

**Sleep Deprivation Consequences:**
- Insulin resistance
- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
- Impaired cognitive health (risk of Alzheimer's and dementia)
- High stress levels activate sympathetic response and metabolic dysfunction

**Sleep Stages:**
- **REM Sleep:** Dream stage; important for creativity, problem-solving, procedural memory, processing emotional memories, maintaining emotional awareness
- **Deep NREM Sleep:** Long-term memory consolidation in hippocampus; brain cleanup (clearing out amyloid beta and tau - two proteins found in Alzheimer's patients)

**Sleep Medications:**
- Ambien or benzodiazepines induce unconsciousness without improving sleep quality
- Exception: Trazodone at low dose can improve sleep architecture (also supplement ashwagandha)

**Assessment Tools:**
- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (best validated)
- Epworth Sleepiness Scale
- Insomnia Severity Index
- STOP-BANG questionnaire (rule out sleep apnea)
- Sleep study

**Tips for Better Sleep:**
- Room darkness
- Limit LED light exposure 2 hours before bed
- Limit cellphone/computer use
- Cool bedroom (65°F)
- Warm bath before bed
- No alcohol or caffeine
- Exercise during the day
- Avoid stressful thoughts
- Meditation
- Avoid foods within 3 hours of bedtime
- **Goal:** Increase "sleep pressure"

#### IV. EMOTIONAL HEALTH

**Definition:** The way we regulate emotions and manage interpersonal relationships

**Importance:** Perhaps the most important of all

**Childhood Trauma Effects:**
Some children grow up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults with:
1. Various addictions
2. Co-dependency or excessive psychological reliance on another person
3. Habituated survival strategies (anger, rage)
4. Attachment disorders

**Tools for Emotional Health:**
1. **Reframing** events and experiences
2. **Mindfulness meditation**
3. **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Helps those who are suicidal or at risk of self-harm
   - Aimed at breaking chain reaction: negative stimulus → negative emotion → negative thought → negative reaction
   - **4 Pillars joined by mindfulness:**
     - Emotional regulation
     - Distress tolerance
     - Interpersonal effectiveness
     - Self-management

**David Brooks' "The Road to Character":**
- **"Resume virtues":** Degrees and jobs
- **"Eulogy virtues":** What family/friends will remember us by

### BOTTOM LINE: Know Your "Why"

Why pursue longevity if you're not happy? Need clarity, purpose, and meaning.

> "I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future. If you want to find someone's true age, listen to them. If they talk about the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did, they've gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their aspirations, what they're looking forward to—they're young."

### 15 "Cowbell" Metrics of True Happiness

*Source: Dan Witters, Research Director of Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index since 2008*

**If you agree with these statements, you are happier than most people:**

1. You manage your finances well and live within your means. You have enough money to do everything you want to do.
2. You set and reach goals on an ongoing basis.
3. You always make time for trips or vacations with family and friends.
4. You use your strengths to do what you do best every day.

12. You don't smoke.
13. You are of a normal, healthy weight.
14. You exercise at least 30 minutes at least three days per week.
15. You are active and productive every day.

**Key Quote - E.B. White:**
> "I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day."

**The key:** Find that sweet spot between savoring life now and doing things that lead to a richer, more meaningful outcome in the future.

## Book Summary: "How Will You Measure Your Life?" by Clayton Christensen

Success in life is not solely about achieving professional goals or accumulating wealth. It's about finding personal happiness, maintaining good relationships, and living with integrity. It's important to have a clear sense of purpose and to align your actions with your values.

Life is a delicate balance of personal and professional commitments. It's crucial to invest time and energy in your relationships and personal growth, just as you would in your career. The most fulfilling lives are those filled with meaningful relationships and activities, not just professional achievements.

It's also essential to maintain your integrity and stay true to your moral compass. Compromising your values for short-term gains can lead to long-term dissatisfaction and regret.

Remember, your life's measure is not in material possessions, but in the lives you've touched, the love you've shared, and the values you've upheld.

In the end, it's not about how much you've achieved, but who you've become as a person. So, strive to live a life that you can be proud of, a life that truly reflects who you are and what you believe in.

## Personal Reflections

### High School Valedictorian Speech (1999)
Quote used: "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." — JFK

### 40th Birthday Reflection (2021)

As I reach midlife with my big 40th birthday (by the average US life expectancy), I think back at 18 years old what I had envisioned my life to be in the future. I gave my high school valedictorian speech urging my fellow graduates to strive for greatness by quoting President John F. Kennedy, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."

By any standards the journey to 40 has been an extraordinary ride, achieving many of my dreams and financial freedom (as a car lover, the Ferrari for my 40th birthday is just a marker of this milestone). With my relentless pursuit of excellence and endless thirst for knowledge, I have obtained 2 doctoral degrees, an MBA, and on my way to completing my 3rd doctorate next year in organizational change and leadership. Going to Harvard for my M.D. was a once in a lifetime opportunity as well as completing my surgery training at the #1 hospital in the country! All done while raising 2 healthy, handsome, and intelligent boys with the unwavering support of husband. I'm truly humbled by the many blessings God has bestowed on me. But, as I always remind myself, "To whom much is given, much is expected." I constantly strive for greater impact everyday and I'm grateful for the opportunity to inspire countless others and empower them to seek their own greatness and to join me in changing the world, one person at a time. As Mother Teresa once said, "You don't have to go to Calcutta to make a difference. Find your own Calcutta wherever you are."

Beyond money, titles, degrees, fame, power, pleasure, and honor, deep down what human beings seek are: someone to love, something to do, and something to look forward to. The Japanese call this "ikigai," a reason for being or your purpose/your why.

In the next 40 years, I aim to give even more of the 3 T's back to the world: Time, Talent, and Treasure. Glory to God!

### 42nd Birthday Reflection (2023)

**From Facebook:**

Thank you everyone for all your birthday wishes! I feel tremendous love ❤️ For my 42nd birthday this year, I got myself a Bentley and yet another trip to a beautiful and special place to celebrate. I have been lucky and intentional in going to special and beautiful places for my birthdays :) This year it's Athens/Mykonos/Santorini/Istanbul and in the past, my husband and I celebrated my birthdays in Singapore/Bali and Dubai/Maldives. I like the combination of big historical cities with beautiful island resorts :) I will continue to measure my life by the 5F's (Faith, Family, Friends, Fitness, Finance) and to always strive to give back the 3T's: Time, Talent, and Treasure...

**On the Bentley Purchase:**

My early 42nd birthday present this year: a Bentley! I guess I have officially joined the "club" as an average Rolls-Royce owner has 7 cars in his/her garage. My dream garage now has a collection of Ferrari, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, and Tesla (my oldest one). Looking back when we were growing up, my brother and I used to think how amazing it would be to wake up in the morning and drive a different car everyday...well, he is no longer with us but I have made our dream a reality! I have always been a crazy car lover and still remember the first car I ever bought with my own money, a titanium silver 2004 BMW 325Ci convertible, after college...my parents still kept the car in immaculate condition until we finally sold it last year, which was 18 years later! However, no matter how crazy I am about cars, I have not forgotten to invest smartly to become financially independent, allowing me to cut down to part-time work (Tues-Wed-Thursday only) this year to do more travel, volunteer work, and go out of town on my long weekends as well as spend more time with our boys, Matthew and John...Thanks be to God!

### 44th Birthday Reflection (2025)

Jesus Christ is risen, Alleluia ✝️ 🙏 Happy Easter! What a double blessing it is since my 44th birthday this year falls on Easter! I always keep in mind the idea of "memento mori" or "remember we all will die" to remind myself that life on earth is a pilgrimage and that death is a certainty...however, Jesus has defeated death to give me hope for eternal life if I live life in the here and now with purpose and focus on building up treasures in heaven...all the honors, degrees, houses, cars, etc. are just transient happiness and not eternal bliss. I happen to share my birthday with Queen Elizabeth II and in my birth year of 1981 the Association of Women Surgeons was founded (what a coincidence). The call to greatness was there from the very beginning and I have always lived with that in mind in everything I do. But, no matter what, the greatest challenge for greatness is to answer God's call to become a saint because only saints go to heaven...So, on this Easter and my birthday, I thank God for his many blessings, especially the gifts of life and faith.

May I persevere in faith until the very end when He calls me home...just as He just called our beloved Pope Francis home. I will forever remember Pope Francis every year on my birthday (since after all my younger son John's middle name is "Francis" and he was born in 2013, the same year Pope Francis became pope)...May he rest in peace 🙏 ✝️

"Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen."
