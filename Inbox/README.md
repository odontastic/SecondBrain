# Inbox - Processing Hub

**Purpose:** Capture point for all incoming items before they're organized into Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archives.

## Inbox Structure

### 1. To Read (`to_read_list.md`)
Reading list, articles, videos, resources to consume.

**Workflow:**
- Add items as you discover them
- Prioritize based on goals
- Read during dedicated reading time
- After reading: move insights to "Needs Processing" or link to relevant Projects/Areas

---

### 2. To Think About (`to_think_about.md`)
Open-ended ideas, questions, and thoughts for contemplative reflection.

**Workflow:**
- Add items that need reflection but aren't urgent
- Review during quiet moments (walks, breaks)
- No pressure to resolve immediately
- Move to "Needs Processing" when clarity emerges
- Move to Projects if action becomes clear

---

### 3. Needs Processing (`needs_processing.md`)
Items requiring dedicated work time for deeper processing, connecting ideas, reviewing.

**Workflow:**
- Schedule dedicated processing sessions (30-60 min)
- Process: highlight, connect, expand, clarify
- After processing: move to Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archives
- Review weekly during Sunday review

---

### 4. Daily Notes Template (`daily_notes_template.md`)
Daily workflow template for morning routine, priorities, schedule, work shutdown, and reflection.

**Workflow:**

- Review at end of day
- Archive weekly (move to Archives with date prefix)

### 5. Current Section (`current_section.md`)
Track active items: people to discuss with, tasks on hold, conversations in progress.
