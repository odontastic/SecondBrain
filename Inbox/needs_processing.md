# Needs Processing

**Purpose:** Items that need dedicated work time for deeper processing, connecting ideas, highlighting, reviewing, or reworking.

**Processing Guidelines:**
- These require focused attention (not passive thinking)
- Schedule dedicated processing time (30-60 min blocks)
- Good for weekly review or dedicated processing sessions
- After processing, items move to:
  - Projects (if actionable with deadline)
  - Areas (if ongoing responsibility)
  - Resources (if reference material)
  - Archives (if completed/processed)
