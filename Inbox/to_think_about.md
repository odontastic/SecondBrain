# To Think About

**Purpose:** Ideas, questions, and thoughts that need reflection but aren't urgent. Can be pondered away from computer.

**Processing Guidelines:**
- Items here are intentionally vague or open-ended
- Good for contemplative time (walks, breaks, quiet moments)
- No pressure to resolve immediately
- Move to "Needs Processing" when clarity emerges
- Move to Projects if action becomes clear

## Notes
- Review weekly during Sunday review
- Some items may stay here indefinitely (that's okay)
- Some will naturally resolve or become clearer
- Trust the process - not everything needs immediate answers
