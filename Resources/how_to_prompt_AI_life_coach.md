How to prompt AI to be a life coach
Structured Summary for Knowledge Base:

CORE ANALYSIS
- Primary Message: AI can simulate the role of a life coach by following a structured, multi-step process to guide users through life planning, skill assessment, and goal achievement. While it offers broad, accessible advice, it has notable limitations in personalization and expertise.
- Main Thesis: AI uses patterns from its training data to provide life coaching, but lacks real-world experience and credentials.
- Key Takeaway: AI is a practical, always-available tool for life guidance, best used for general advice and structured planning rather than highly personalized coaching.
