# Archives Master Index

## Overview
Archives contain completed projects, obsolete resources, and historical content that is no longer active but may be valuable for reference or historical tracking.

## Archive Categories

### LifeOS Original (04-Archives/LifeOS-Original/)
Content from the original LifeOS system structure before PARA integration.

### Projects Completed (04-Archives/Projects-Completed/)
Successfully completed projects that are no longer active.

### Areas Deprecated (04-Archives/Areas-Deprecated/)
Life areas that have been restructured, combined, or are no longer relevant.

### Resources Obsolete (04-Archives/Resources-Obsolete/)
Superseded resources, outdated information, and replaced materials.

### Historical (04-Archives/Historical/)
Version history, evolution tracking, and system development records.

## Archive Management

### Archive Criteria
- **Projects**: Completed successfully or cancelled
- **Areas**: No longer relevant or significantly restructured
- **Resources**: Superseded by newer versions or no longer accurate
- **Content**: Outdated but potentially valuable for reference

### Retention Policy
- **Completed Projects**: Retain indefinitely for reference
- **Deprecated Areas**: Keep for 2 years, then evaluate
- **Obsolete Resources**: Retain for 1 year unless historically significant
- **Historical Data**: Permanent retention

### Access and Retrieval
- Archives are searchable and accessible
- Links are maintained to prevent broken references
- Historical context is preserved in metadata
- Recovery procedures documented
