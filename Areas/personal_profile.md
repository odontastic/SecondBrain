# **Comprehensive Personal Profile -- Integral Edition (Gemini+Perplexity)**

## **Purpose**

This profile aggregates and synthesizes all available data---explicit
self-assessments, behavioral evidence, technical details, core values,
and inferred psychological patterns---into a holistic view. It is
constructed for serious personal development, reflective practice, and
strategic coaching, yielding a detailed "internal map" of motivations,
challenges, and the interplay of logic, faith, and emotion in all key
life domains.

## **I. Executive Summary**

You are a highly analytical, intellectually independent individual, best
described as a "system-builder" (INTP/Architect) with deep spiritual
commitments and a family-oriented sense of purpose. Life is structured
around three core pillars: Roman Catholic faith, the primacy of family
(devout wife and two sons), and a relentless pursuit of self-mastery
across intellectual, technical, and relational domains. Your central
developmental project is to bridge an abstract, powerful logical mind
with the messy, emotional realities of close relationships. You strive
to "engineer" personal growth through evidence, structure, and
reflective practice, recognizing the irreducible complexity---and
frustration---of human emotions.

## **II. Core Identity & Guiding Principles**

## **Spiritual Foundation**

-   Life is anchored in Roman Catholic faith and sacramental practice,
    viewing life as a shared spiritual journey toward virtue and heaven;
    each family member is seen as responsible for supporting the others'
    spiritual progress.

## **Family Centrality**

-   Highest life priority is the well-being and flourishing of your
    nuclear family (wife and two sons).

-   Father's name: Leo Tung.

-   Many self-improvement efforts are explicitly oriented to your roles
    as husband and father.

## **Cultural and Social Identity**

-   American-born Chinese (ABC); this bicultural perspective subtly
    influences attitudes toward personal responsibility, family, and
    education.

-   Socially, you report a tendency toward being a "loner," with few, if
    any, close long-term friendships, and openly cite deficits in
    emotional intelligence and self-awareness as key growth areas.

## **Core Values**

-   Truth & Evidence: Deep commitment to realism; trust is placed in
    empirical research and expert consensus, with explicit rejection of
    conspiracy theories or unsupported claims.

-   Mastery & Competence: Enduring desire to achieve deep, broad
    understanding and functional mastery in every area of
    importance---technical, psychological, and spiritual.

-   Contribution & Legacy: Intention to help others, especially your
    family, and to consciously build a meaningful future and enduring
    legacy.

-   Inner Well-being: Ongoing, evidence-driven cultivation of internal
    tranquility and joy, seen as essential to authentic flourishing.

## **III. Personality and Cognitive Blueprint**

## **Cognitive Style**

-   Intellectual independence and a philosophical, system-building
    orientation; happiest when deconstructing problems from first
    principles and creating elegant, customized solutions.

-   Structured, model-driven mindset; you build personal "life toolkits"
    with modular frameworks for thought and action.

-   Strong tendency to thrive in and seek out complexity, using depth of
    understanding and customization for a sense of control and
    clarity---even in uncertain or ambiguous environments.

## **Approach to Emotion and Spirituality**

-   Central internal tension: The lifelong effort to reconcile logical,
    structured cognition with the unpredictable realities of emotions
    and interpersonal dynamics, especially within the family.

-   Motivated to "engineer" emotional growth with the same rigor as
    technical mastery, while aware this aspiration creates persistent
    frustration and feeds tendencies toward isolation.

## **Drive for Holistic Mastery**

-   You explicitly seek not just technical proficiency but emotional
    intelligence, relational skills, and spiritual integration---aware
    these are the foundations of your ability to love well and fulfill
    your familial roles.

-   Growth and self-awareness are approached methodically, with regular
    practices (reflection, journaling, coaching, faith-based routines)
    and a focus on illuminating blind spots.

## **IV. Motivations, Internal Dynamics, & Key Projects**

## **Central Inner Conflict**

-   Primary developmental tension is the mismatch between a structured,
    logical approach to life and the "messy," relational/affective
    dimensions of reality.

-   There is a conscious recognition that your habitual "systematizing"
    can, at times, impede intimacy or emotional spontaneity.

## **Core Motivations**

-   The "holy grail" is integrative self-mastery: to combine clarity,
    competence, and emotional attunement for the benefit of your
    immediate family and as a witness to your faith and heritage.

-   The sense of duty---both religious and familial---is a principal
    motivating factor.

## **Life Projects**

1.  Emotional Intelligence & Relationship Growth

    -   Objective: Translate logic-driven understanding into lived
        connection with spouse and sons.

    -   Methods: Deliberate study and practice of relational skills,
        focusing on evidence-based frameworks (e.g., executive coaching
        tools, Gottman method, Ignatian examen adapted for reflection).

    -   Stated challenge: "I lack emotional intelligence, relationship
        skills, self-awareness, and self-reflection." The social result
        is "I tend to be a loner and have no close or long-term
        friends."

2.  Holistic Well-being & Longevity

    -   Objective: Age gracefully; sustain a foundation for lifelong
        personal and family vitality.

    -   Methods: Preference for health-related practices and routines
        supported by scientific evidence (esp. food, drink, exercise,
        and rest).

3.  Knowledge Mastery & Workflow Engineering

    -   Objective: Maximize impact and efficiency using personalized
        productivity, PKM, and project management workflows.

    -   Methods: Ongoing evaluation and customization of FOSS tools
        (visual workspaces, AI-assisted note-taking) adapted for
        household coordination.

    project-management tools focused on Kanban (with "true" swimlanes),
    visual layouts, and seamless combination of note-taking and
    scheduling features for single-user/household use.

-   Holds high standards for feature design, documentation, and the
    ability to visualize and layer info (references: Vikunja, Kanboard,
    Wekan, Focalboard, OpenProject, xTiles, Coda, NotebookLM, and RAG
    pipelines).

-   Has evaluated AI-augmented note-taking tools and researched
    integration of local LLMs for coaching, structured reflection, and
    personal RAG applications.

## **Household and Travel Habits**

-   Coordinates schedules, tasks, and routines for a small family

## **X. Final Synthesis**

You are a deeply reflective, rational, and spiritually anchored
system-builder. Your life's work is to harness your intellectual agility
and systematizing strengths to serve your highest commitments: faith,
family, and self-mastery. You are candid about your growth areas---most
centrally, emotional intelligence and relational skills---and pursue
their development with the same rigor you bring to technical domains.
All efforts are grounded in evidence, structured reflection, and the
enduring belief that mastery and genuine love are both possible and
necessary, even if the path together is complex and, at times,
paradoxical.

document for personal development, coaching, and deep reflection.

# **Comprehensive Personal Profile**

## **Purpose**

This document brings together all available self-reported, behavioral,
and inferred information about you. It is meant as a reference for
personal growth, serious self-reflection, and targeted coaching,
capturing your internal landscape, core drivers, and key developmental
tensions.

## **I. Executive Summary**

You are a highly analytic, intellectually self-reliant
system-builder---emblematic of the INTP/"Architect" archetype---who
positions Roman Catholic faith, family (wife and two sons), and
self-mastery at the center of life goals. Your main project is closing
the gap between robust, logical frameworks and the unpredictable,
nuanced world of emotion---both internally and in relationships. You
pursue authentic connection and personal growth as engineered systems,
experiencing intrinsic tension when emotions resist rational patterns.
Self-reflection, structured learning, and intentional coaching are the
levers deployed toward your quest for deeper integration and lasting
relational richness.

## **II. Core Identity and Guiding Principles**

-   Faith as Foundation: Roman Catholic practice, doctrine, and a
    family-as-faith-community perspective organize your sense of purpose
    and day-to-day orientation. Personal development is fundamentally
    attuned to spiritual growth for yourself and loved ones.

    understanding multi-layered technical, logistical, or philosophical
    problems.

-   Appreciative Observer: There's an abiding respect for perseverance,
    beauty, and technical excellence in art, systems, and nature itself.

## **IV. Core Tensions and Motivations**

-   Central Inner Conflict: The main struggle is reconciling logical,
    systematic thinking with the emotional turbulence of human
    experience---especially in love and family. You wish to "engineer"
    greater emotional and relational skill, sometimes frustrated when
    these domains refuse tidy solutions.

-   Key Motivation: The heart of your journey is to become a more
    integrated, emotionally intelligent, and present husband and
    father---not only understanding but truly embodying love. Your duty
    to family and faith animates all sustained effort.

## **V. Principal Life Projects**

1.  Emotional Intelligence and Relational Growth

    -   Goal: Demonstrate love, build connection, and model healthy
        relationships for your family.

    -   Approach: Evidence-based exercises (Gottman, executive coaching,
        Catholic reflection), self-assessed gaps ("I lack emotional
