# Pool Maintenance & Water Care

## Area Overview
As part of household management responsibilities, I maintain the swimming pool and surrounding area, ensuring safe, clean water and proper equipment function. Currently managing several active equipment maintenance projects.

## Current Responsibilities

### Daily/Weekly Pool Care
- **Water chemistry monitoring**: pH, chlorine, alkalinity levels
- **Skimming and cleaning**: Surface debris removal, bottom cleaning
- **Filter maintenance**: Regular cleaning and maintenance of pool filtration system
- **Equipment checks**: Monitoring pump, heater, and other pool equipment

### Palm Tree Maintenance
- **Small Palms by Pool**: Seasonal pruning after flowering
  - Schedule: Seasonal, ideally just after flowering
  - Purpose: Prevent pollen, seeds, and fruit from creating litter
  - Last Activity: November 11, 2025
  - Next Scheduled: After next flowering cycle

## 🚨 Active Maintenance Projects

### 1. Hayward Automatic Water Filler Float Replacement
- **Status**: Parts identification phase
- **Priority**: High
- **Next Action**: Look up model and obtain part number for 2 units
- **Dependency**: Part compatibility verification with pool system
- **Timeline**: Identify parts by November 18, 2025
- **Completion Criteria**: Order placed and parts received for installation
- **Progress**: 0% - Not yet ordered, waiting for part identification

### 2. Jandy Valve Gasket Replacement
- **Status**: Parts identification phase
- **Priority**: High
- **Next Action**: Inspect valve and locate correct part number
- **Dependency**: Physical valve inspection and compatibility verification
- **Timeline**: Inspect valve by November 15, 2025
- **Completion Criteria**: New gasket installed and leak resolved
- **Progress**: 0% - Not yet ordered, inspection required

### 3. Pump Area Leak Diagnosis
- **Status**: Active investigation
- **Priority**: High
- **Current Finding**: Leak identified at Jandy valve
- **Next Action**: Complete full system inspection to check for additional leaks
- **Dependency**: Comprehensive diagnostic assessment
- **Timeline**: Complete diagnosis by November 20, 2025
- **Completion Criteria**: All leaks identified and repair plan implemented
- **Progress**: 25% - Jandy valve leak identified, ongoing inspection

## Recurring Tasks
| Task | Frequency | Next Due | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Water chemistry testing | Weekly | Ongoing | Active |
| Pool cleaning | 2-3 times per week | Ongoing | Active |
| Filter cleaning | Monthly | TBD | Active |
| Palm pruning | Seasonal | After flowering | Recent update 11/11/25 |
| Equipment inspection | Weekly | Ongoing | Active (Enhanced for leak monitoring) |

## Equipment & Resources
- Pool testing kits and chemicals
- Cleaning equipment (nets, brushes, vacuum)
- Filter maintenance tools
- Palm pruning tools and equipment
- **Pool equipment parts**: Hayward water filler floats, Jandy valve gaskets
- **Diagnostic tools**: Leak detection equipment, pressure testing tools

## Pool Chemistry Standards
- **pH Level**: 7.2-7.8
- **Chlorine Level**: 1-3 ppm
- **Total Alkalinity**: 80-120 ppm
- **Cyanuric Acid**: 30-50 ppm

## Project Dependencies & Timeline
```
Phase 1: Parts Identification (Nov 11-18, 2025)
├── Hayward float part lookup
├── Jandy valve inspection
└── Leak diagnostic completion

Phase 2: Procurement (Nov 18-25, 2025)
├── Parts ordering
├── Delivery coordination
└── Installation preparation

Phase 3: Repair & Testing (Nov 25-Dec 1, 2025)
