Organize by project, not by topic (such as psychology or marketing) or kind of information (quotes, book notes, insights)

Projects have a goal and a completion date; Areas have a standard to maintain indefinitely
Actively working on

Areas are ongoing responsibilities (for personally relevant info)
Roles & responsibilities

Resources are interests or research (for generally useful info)

A Project without a Goal is a hobby, and a Goal without a Project is a dream

Move notes (or even entire notebooks) when you notice they fit better elsewhere, rather than on a schedule

Move quickly, touch lightly. Use your intuition when organizing, rather than trying to categorize everything perfectly

5 Simple PARA Rules
Rule 1: Only create a new folder or container when you have something to put in it.
Rule 2: Don't overthink where to put information; use your intuition.
Rule 3: Information is dynamic and can be moved as needed.
Rule 4: Use the search function to find information quickly.
Rule 5: If you feel overwhelmed, archive everything and start fresh.

Have you ever saved something to reference later but forgotten where you stored it? Or felt overwhelmed by everything you need to organize? Perhaps you’ve thought, “I should create a better system for storing and finding my files, tasks, and projects.”

You’re not alone. Information overload has been a workplace (and personal!) problem for more than a decade. The worst part? It’s only growing.

Tiago Forte saw it coming. So, he developed the PARA method – a digital organization system that helps you organize your tasks, ideas, and resources in a simple way. The best part? It’s easy to implement and flexible to mould according to your needs.

In this article, I’ll explain the PARA method's details, origin, and benefits, and show you how to implement it in Todoist.

What is the PARA method?
Put simply, the PARA method is a system to organize your digital life with its abundance of apps, platforms, and websites (although you can use the principles with your physical files, too). Here’s what the acronym stands for:

Projects: These are the current tasks you’re working on. Projects are for the short-term and have a clear deadline or foreseeable completion date. For example, your sales presentation tomorrow is a project you need to work on.

Areas: Zoom out a little bit, and you’ll see the large pieces of your life that keep things in motion. These are long-term responsibilities that require continual maintenance with no end in sight. Your health, family, travel, and productivity would be the “areas” in the PARA method.

Resources: These are the things you read or come across and would want to save for the future. It can be work-related – like a sales tactic you’d like to experiment with – or personal – like your hobbies.

Archives: This one’s self-explanatory. Archives are anything from the above three categories you don’t need anymore – but might need in the future. For example, if you were working on a house renovation project in a place you no longer live in, that project can move into the archive folder.

The goal is to organize your entire life into four folders to reduce your overwhelm and find what you need when you search for it without scrambling.

para-method-1
Many people often get hung up on the difference between a project and an area and struggle to categorize their information or ideas.

The first solution to this is to follow your gut. Don’t overthink it – trust your intuition. The aim isn’t to categorize everything perfectly, but to organize everything you need in an actionable, easy-to-maintain-way.

That said, I know this answer isn’t always easy to digest. So, here’s a flowchart to guide you in making the right choice:

Learning to categorize using the PARA method
Tiago Forte created the PARA method as a part of his larger project, Building A Second Brain. There’s a whole book dedicated to the PARA method if you get inclined to dive even deeper into this system.

Should you go PARA (and never go back)? 3 Benefits of the PARA Method
I hear the groans. “Ugh. Do I need yet another system to organize my life better?”

If your existing method is working efficiently – helping you store and categorize everything in that big brain – then great! But if you often find yourself anxious, scrambling to get things done, hunting for that one file you were sure you saved, it’s worth considering adding the PARA method to your life. Here are the top three benefits you’ll see almost immediately:

1: You’ll experience less mental load and decision fatigue
You consume a lot of information in a day. And your brain pops nearly a gazillion ideas, too. Without an organization system like the PARA method in place, you’ll lose all those gems.

With the PARA method, you’ll take the load off your shoulders. You won’t stay up past your bedtime tallying everything you have to “remember” because you didn’t store and categorize it anywhere.

And you wouldn’t have to decide, “Where do I put this so I can find it when I need it?” about any note, file, or piece of information because you’ve already set up a system with four possible options.

2: You’ll find what you need, when you need it
How many times have you thought, “I’ll just remember it!” and forgotten something important? Or needed to refer to something and thought, “I know I saved that somewhere...” and never found the resource again? Been there, done that (too many times).

The PARA method ensures you keep your brain organized so you can find exactly what you need whenever you need it. You won’t have to rummage around a messy (digital) drawer to find what you’re looking for. All you have to do is search for it within one of the four folders.

3: Your productivity and focus will improve
The PARA method is a way to organize your life – you’ll know the most important priorities of your life (areas), the things you need to actively work on & when (projects), and have a catch-all folder for anything else you need (resources). Imagine the level of clarity you’ll gain once you’ve set up your life using the PARA system over a long period of time.

And having this clarity and focus will allow your productivity to soar and your creativity to shine. Instead of spending your time deciding, finding, or organizing, you’ll spend your time getting things done.

How to set up and implement the PARA system with Todoist in 5 steps
The core philosophy behind the PARA method is to have the same organizational system everywhere – in your cloud files, note-taking apps, and task management software. This makes it easy for you to find what you’re looking for and reduces the mental load of creating a new organizational system for different apps and software.

This section will share how you can use the PARA method to organize your (never-ending) to-do list in Todoist.

Step 1: List down every task that’s on your mind
The first step is to list everything you’re currently working on. You can work on categorizing them into projects, areas, resources, and archives later. Just open Todoist and start noting down everything in the Inbox. Put everything that comes to mind without leaving anything out.

Organize my bookshelf task
I’d also advise checking your email, calendar, to-do list app, and collaboration software to ensure you aren’t missing adding anything crucial. Maybe you notice you forgot to add an ongoing client issue to your list. This brainstorming session will help you clear your head and lay everything you need to work on in front of you.

Step 2: Categorize your tasks to fit the PARA method
Once you’ve added everything in Todoist, add three projects in Todoist for your projects, areas, and resources:

Projects, areas and resources
How do you decide which task goes into which section?

If the task has a definite goal and completion date, it’s a project

If the task requires ongoing commitment with no deadline, it’s an area

If the task is an article, book, video, etc., you’d like to watch or refer to, it’s a resource

Let’s say you’ve written down the following tasks:

Dog training

Building an exercise routine

Referring to your notes on a business book to improve a specific skill

Dog training is something you need to do, and it has an end in sight – it will be done one day. So, it’s a project. But building an exercise routine is a forever thing. It won’t be over once and you’ll never have to do it again – it’s a lifetime commitment. So, it’s an area. And referring to a book for work is a resource because you might need to use your notes again.

Start moving the tasks from your Inbox folder into their designated folders within the PARA method.

Move tasks to projects
Some of the tasks on your list might be what Forte calls “false projects.” These are either dreams with no deadlines (like learning a new language or instrument) or hobbies (like crocheting). You need to remove these from your organization system to improve your focus, prioritize, and reduce the overwhelm.

Forte advises having anywhere between 10–15 active projects at one time – including personal and professional domains. This ensures:

a) you don’t have too much on your plate at once – leading you to abandon the PARA system altogether

b) you have another project to work on if one project takes the backseat or needs a breather

Forte explains:

“I’ve found that around 10-15 projects seems to be the right range for most people. That’s enough that if you get stuck on one, you have multiple other options to turn to, instead of getting completely bogged down. It’s also few enough that you can see them all at a glance, and review and reflect on them on a weekly basis.”

Forte also classifies megaprojects under false projects. These are tasks that are so big that they need to be broken down into multiple sub-projects.

Think of things like revamping your website or renovating your house: These are too big to be just one project. Instead, you can break down “revamping your website” into “rewriting the About page” and “working on the UI” as two separate projects. Similarly, you can divide the “renovating your house” task into sub-projects based on various rooms.

Having megaprojects can make it overwhelming to begin and navigate your to-do list. If you’ve broken down a big project into smaller parts, they feel much more achievable and help you craft a clear path for your next steps.

What if you have more than 15 projects that you don’t want to delete? Put them in a “Future notes” folder if you don’t currently have the heart to let go of them.

What about archives? When a project is done or you want to close it, Todoist allows you to archive it.

Archive
You can see these archived projects by clicking “Archived projects” under “My Projects.”

Step 3: Start adding specific tasks to your projects & areas
You can’t work on 10–15 projects simultaneously. Some might be more urgent than others, while others might be spread out over a few months.

First, you should create various “sections” within Todoist for each project. Let’s say two of your projects are writing an article about a topic and organizing your bookshelf. Here’s what the various tasks within each of those projects might look like:

Sections
Next, start assigning priorities and deadlines to each task. Remember projects in the PARA method are defined by the fact that they have a completion date. Assigning a deadline to each sub-task within a project will ensure you have set a timeline to finish each project you’ve decided to take on.

Prioritize
⚡ Pro-tip: Remember to assign priorities based on how your overall day and week looks — taking into account tasks from other projects and areas.

Now, let’s move on to areas. These are the ongoing tasks in your life that require you to maintain a standard. In Todoist, create sections for the various areas you’ve chosen – like Health, Finance, and Relationships.

Next, start assigning recurring tasks to them. For example, in the Health area, you might want to:

meal prep every Sunday

go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday

get regular medical checkups done at the start of every quarter


Todoist lets you create recurring tasks simply by typing your desired frequency. For meal prepping every Sunday, all you have to do is type, “Meal prep every Sunday,” and a recurring task will be created. You’ll see it on your set frequency without adding it every week.

Add recurring date
Once you’ve set up recurring tasks to maintain all the areas of your life, you’ll have a fine-looking board of your life rituals. These are the tasks you have to continually do at a consistent frequency – until you decide to erase the area altogether.

Areas
Step 4: Use labels and links to interlink everything
Labels in Todoist help you assign a specific tag to each task. You can use this method to collate various tasks within various PARA categories into one window.

Let’s say you have a Health area, a “run a 5K” project, and a resource about preparing for your first run. All these things are related, even though they belong in different PARA folders. When you assign a label to them, you can search for them easily in Todoist and get everything you need from all the folders in one place.

Area priorities
Pssst…you can quickly assign labels to your tasks by using “@” and adding your label name.

Similarly, you can also grab the link of a Todoist task within your resources and add them under task descriptions within projects.

Let’s say you collected running resources for a while and have finally taken “run a 5K” as a project. Now, you want to match your resources to specific project tasks. Easy-peasy: Just copy the link of the resource task and add it to the project task.

Resources
You can also do this by collecting resources for specific areas of your life and interlinking them to the right place. This way, you’ve made a carefully crafted web of interlinking tasks within your system. You’re setting yourself up for success because when you open a task, you have everything you need within it already.

Note: If you’ve chosen to store your Resources in a separate note-taking app, link those specific notes to Todoist to replicate the interlinking web. Forte recommends having the exact same projects and areas – including their names – across all your apps. This way, your priorities and life organization are clear and consistent, no matter what software you’re on.

Interlinking your projects, areas, and resources is optional. You don’t need to do it to implement the PARA method. It’s an ideal choice if you’d like to have one category linking to another, but they can function independently, too.

Step 5: Archive tasks that you have finished or discarded
The last step is tidying up your Todoist so you always have a clear idea of what you’re working on.

Archive a project when all tasks within it are complete or when you’ve chosen to outsource/discontinue the project

Archive an area when you’ve decided not to maintain a specific standard or do a set number of tasks in any department of your life

Archive a resource when you’re finished reading it and aren’t sure if you’ll use it or have simply lost interest in the subject

For example, let’s say you decided to learn Spanish in the new year and set up an Area for it. You had a three-month project to master the basics and various resources at your disposal. If you decide not to pursue this goal after your quarter-long project is complete, you can archive the whole area and its resources.

Remember that maintaining the system by archiving inactive projects, areas, and resources is just as important as taking action. Archiving means you don’t see incomplete or abandoned tasks that can derail your focus and motivation. It goes the other way, too: If you’ve decided to work on an archived project, remove it from there and put it under Projects.

Information should flow freely between the four components of PARA. When you’re using Todoist on the go and think of a task, add it to the Inbox folder and move on. Set aside 10 minutes every week to assign those tasks to the right folder.

Tiago also recommends doing a weekly review of your projects to check on their progress and doing the same thing for areas of your life on a monthly or quarterly basis:

“My weekly review is mostly focused on my projects, since they are actionable and moving forward on a weekly basis. On a longer timeframe, such as once a month or every couple of months, I also do a monthly or quarterly review to evaluate my work and life from a more elevated perspective.”

The ultimate goal of the PARA method is to spend less time organizing (without losing anything)
Tiago Forte created the PARA method because he wanted to build a system that’s simple, flexible, and ridiculously easy to maintain. Instead of grandiose setups that take forever to set up and are time-consuming to maintain, PARA’s goal is to minimize time spent “organizing” as much as possible.

Organizing your tasks, notes, and ideas often feels productive but it can also be an excuse for procrastination. With the PARA method, you can have everything you need organized in distinct folders without spending a lot of time and energy maintaining the system.

In this guide we'll show you how to implement Tiago Forte's PARA method inside Workflowy. While the PARA system is commonly used as part of the 'Building a second brain' method, it works perfectly fine as its own independent system. And if you are interested in going on to use the second brain method in the future, learning how to set-up and user PARA will be essential.

What is the PARA method?

PARA is a methodology for organizing digital information and activities in a way that is simple, useful, and flexible. PARA itself is an acronym that stands for 'Projects', 'Areas', 'Resources', and 'Archives' - which are the four main categories that make it up.

The system was developed by Tiago Forte. Tiago developed the system as a way to help manage his knowledge and work at his consulting job. Since then PARA has become a part of the 'Build a second brain' system that Tiago also created and popularized.

The PARA system isn't so much a productivity system as it is an organization method. The idea being that by having all your digital information well organized, you can then easily recall it to be productive, creative, and effective - depending on your specific goals.

How the PARA method works

The PARA method works by grouping information into four main categories. 'Projects', 'Areas', 'Resources', and 'Archives'.
Projects being the most actionable category and Archives the least.

‍

Projects
This is where your active projects will go. Projects are defined as a collection of tasks that are connected to a goal and have a set deadline. These are the concrete activities you want to or need to do.

PARA starts with projects and not tasks as a way to give the system more structure and make it easier to align activities with goals. It's simply easier to group tasks by project and see the progress of a handful of projects vs dozens of individual tasks.

‍

Areas (of responsibility)
The Areas section represents ongoing activities with no set deadline. So things like finances, writing, sales, health. These should be things that require constant upkeep and attention. New projects will generally come from this section as a result of that continual upkeep.

‍

Resources
This section is for holding information around topics that are interesting or useful to you. As the name suggests, these are pieces of information that you would like to keep and refer to in the future. Items from here could feed into existing or new areas you'd like to actively explore.

You can also think of it as your library where you collect information to later use, transform, or repurpose somehow.

One key difference between resources and areas is that resources should be things you're interested in while areas is meant for things you're responsible for.

‍

Archives
Lastly, the archives is where you'll put items from the other three categories that have been completed or are no longer active. So things like complete projects, areas that are no longer active or resources that you are no longer interested in actively maintaining.

The archives serve as a historical registry of your past activities and interests. This can then serve you in the future as a place for reviewing past activities and for reusing useful items.

‍

How do I actually use the PARA method
So once you understand the PARA method structure, when and how do you actually use it?

Tiago recommends you update the system in what he calls 'just-in-time organization'. Essentially that means you organize things in your system as a natural consequence of your work and needs. Instead of scheduling specific chunks of time to do the organization, you simply start working with your system and organize as you go.

This makes sense when you consider that at its core, the PARA method is about organizing information, not managing productivity. Spending time keeping your system pristine and perfectly organized for its own sake doesn't do you any good. Instead, you work on it in batches as you put information into your system or need to pull information out of it.

‍

Information flows
As you use your system, you'll notice there are several flows of information going on. Items will move from one category to another and back.


‍
Items that start out as projects might become areas that you'll need to maintain, or you'll generate resources that you'll want to use later, and finally the project itself will end up in the archive once you're done.



Areas you're responsible for will generate new projects, you'll likely stumble across interesting and useful resources you'll want to keep and once an area is no longer your responsibility, it'll end up in the archive.



Resources will build up until you decide to turn them into projects or areas if you decide you want to work on them continuously.



And Archives could become useful in the future as a source of inspiration or documents you'll be able to reuse. Archived areas or resources might become relevant at some point in the future and you'll be glad you kept them around - making it easy to dust them off and put them back into your areas or resources categories.


How to use the PARA method in Workflowy
As you can see, the PARA method is pretty straightforward. There are not a lot of moving parts and what structure there is, is relatively simple to understand.

Now let's move on to actually implementing it in Workflowy.

The simplest way to get started would be to make a list with the 4 main categories starting with the most actionable at the top and working our way down.


One thing that isn't strictly part of the PARA method is an inbox. As you start to put information into your system, you might decide that there's no need for one and that you're fine putting things directly where they go in real time.

For everyone else we recommend adding an inbox at the top of the four categories as a place to quickly dump information to then organize.


The idea being that as you go along your day and come across pieces of information you want to put into your system, you can simply put them in your inbox without having to think about where they should go.

Then when you have a moment to do some of that 'Just-in-time' organization, start from the inbox, see if there's anything that needs to be organized and then move on to the category you were going to work from.

And that's really all there is to get started. As long as you organize as you go and as you need things, your system will slowly become organized.

‍

Some tips when using the PARA method in Workflowy
Capturing items on the web
Workflowy has a web clipper available for google chrome. This makes it even easier to capture items to your inbox when on the web. So if you use chrome, this is an extension worth checking out. Link to google chrome store‍

‍
While Workflowy's global search is powerful, it's worth considering adding tags to 'folders' in your projects, areas, resources and archive sections. This makes it easier to later click on those tags and spot items that are in sections of your system that you've forgotten about and could now become useful again.

This is becomes more useful as items move from the areas and resources section to the archive. Having a treasure-trove of knowledge is great but if you forget it even exists, it's not really going to be of much use.

If you do tag items, you can then simply search for the filter before you even start a new project to see if there's anything useful in your system you could reuse.

‍

Very large / specialized files
While you might be inclined to try and simply dump everything into Workflowy, there are instances where it's best to keep a certain piece of information somewhere else. If you already use apps like google drive or dropbox, it might make sense to simply leave those items there and instead link to the file. Remember that Workflowy is multi-platform and has a robust web app so linking to external web applications will work just fine - no sense in duplicating files across applications.

Conclusions
So there you have it, Tiago Forte's PARA method. A relatively simple and straightforward system for keeping all your digital information organized in a useful manner.

If you like the system and find it useful, then we recommend you check out more of his work around building a second brain. The PARA method forms the cornerstone of that system so you'll be well on your way.


PARA in Capacities
Applying this popular framework in Capacities

Beth
May 29, 2024· 7 min read
Here at Capacities, we believe folders limit our thinking, and we therefore built an app without them. Instead, we think in objects.
But if you have used Tiago Forte’s PARA system elsewhere, you might be wondering how a PARA setup could translate into Capacities.
What follows is a suggestion from the Capacities team. It is not the only option, but it’s one that might help you think through what PARA could look like for you in our tool.
What is PARA
Before we start, let’s define the components of PARA, with definitions from the PARA method.
PARA is an acronym for a multi-platform organizational structure for digital information, created by Tiago Forte.
Taking each component in turn:
Projects- “short term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now”
Areas- “long term responsibilities you want to manage over time”
Resources- “topics or interests that may be useful in the future”
Archive- “inactive items from the other three categories”
Now we know the definitions, let’s explore how this could look in Capacities.
Projects
We recommend using a project object type. We have a template for this available already.
This is a more functional and flexible approach to unifying information related to one of your projects.
This is because you can give your projects some properties, to hold the information you need for every project you have.
For example, using Forte’s definition, it’s clear we need to know the status of each project, and the time each will take to complete. This helps you know if it’s a project or an area.
Based on this definition, we suggest adding the following properties
Start date (date time property)
End date (date time property)
Status property (tags)
Goal outcome (text property)
Project priority (number property)
Related area (multi select tag property)
Once you’ve set these properties up for your project object type, every new project will automatically have them, without you needing to think about it.
Just create a new project, fill out the information and get to work. If you have a predefined way of approaching your projects, you could also make your own template to apply to each new project. This will help you get started even faster!
In this picture above, you see there is also a large area for you to write in. This is where we can bring related information together about your project, in order to help you complete it.
This is chance to explain a very important point about Capacities: unlike files in folders and subfolders, your content doesn’t live anywhere specific. Objects aren’t moved from A to B, they are just linked to whatever they are useful for. For example, if you have a resource that can help with your project, just link to that resource from your project object with @ or [[]]. Repeat this as much as necessary, until you have all you need to do your project. You can even add notes and tasks in.
In this way, the project object (whose properties you’ve just filled in) replaces a project’s subfolder, and the project object type replaces your projects folder. Then, instead of moving materials into a subfolder, you just link whatever is useful.
The result is the same: click on one place to find all your projects, open each project to see related materials. But it’s much more flexible. This method recognises that resources might be useful for more than one project, but with linking, there is no conflict with where materials need to live.
Long term, this is a sustainable and intuitive system that will help you organize your digital life.
Areas
Areas are clearly very personal, as are the responsibilities within them.
Some examples of areas are: health, home, marketing. As these are long-term categories rather than types of information, they are well suited to tags- one tag per area. You could even put all your area tags in a collection and pin it for easy access in the left-hand sidebar.
Any time you have an object that relates to one of your areas, simply tag it. All objects can be tagged. If something relates to two areas, just tag both. When you click on the tag, you will see all objects tagged with that area. This is a flexible and easy-to-review set up.
You could also build some Map of Content type pages in Capacities to give your areas a hub, similar to how the project objects act as a hub for all objects related to it.
For example, you could create an area object type, where you’d have a Health Area object, a Home Area object and so on, or you could use pages and make a collection of areas. Do whatever makes sense for you!
To make it like a hub for this area, you could embed the area tag. This will automatically update as you tag more things.
But the real advantage is that you also have a place to write things down directly about that area. This is great for brainstorming, planning, reflection and many other things.
Pro users could even add queries in that look at all projects related to an area.
But Capacities gives you this flexibility to explore which layouts, processes and workflows work for you. No need to worry about the rigidity of a folder structure here.
Resources
Your resources are probably going to be lots of different types of information, presented in various formats, about lots of different topics. There is huge variation here, but Capacities’ tags are a very user-friendly, long term solution for managing such information.
This is because tags can be applied to any object type. So If you have a PDF resource, a useful image, a list of notes that are all resources for later, all you’d need to do is tag each one as #resource. You could combine this with your area tags too.
This way your resources are very easily linked to three things
their type (pdf, image, page)
their PARA category (#resources)
their related area
This gives you lots of ways to resurface this resource, without having to find exactly where you put it in a folder structure. Why decide where something has to live, when it can simply show up in multiple places?
Archive
Archiving is assigning a status to your information, so this status can apply to anything in your space. Just as above, the best mechanism for dealing with information like this is a tag. Therefore you can have a tag called archive.
Simply tag any archived objects (be it projects, areas, pdfs, pages or other) with #archive. If you no longer wish to see these objects in your object types, add a filter like this:
If you didn’t want an archive tag, but were using tags elsewhere, you could simply untag whatever is no longer relevant to you. Then it won’t show up when you’re looking through your areas or resources.
This is a quick and easy way to make sure you’re only ever seeing the important, relevant information in your Capacities space.
Inbox
Finally, Tiago Forte also talks about having an inbox. This is another use-case a tag can help with. This time, #inbox.
A common inbox workflow in Capacities is to pin your inbox tag, and review it once per week.
Simply remove the inbox tag when you have processed the information, replacing the inbox tag with area tags, a resource tag or anything else!
An example
If you have previously used an app based on files and folders, this will be a new way of working for you. So we created a video walking you through how you might set up PARA in Capacities.
But here’s another example.
Say you come across a useful article online that you think could help you in your job for an ongoing project. You probably have areas for your job, such as marketing.
This article is particularly useful for the marketing area. You can save the link to Capacities as a weblink object. This automatically saves the title of the webpage, the url, and an image. On top of this, you are able to tag the weblink and add notes to it.
This is great, you can tag this new weblink with #marketing and #resource. Next you can go to your ongoing project, and @ the name of this new weblink. Now it’s embedded in your project page where you need it, and it’s available as a resource, and it’s related to this area of your job!
Summary
Overall, the PARA method is a popular way of organizing information that can work very well in Capacities. In order to find success with PARA in Capacities, it’s important to adjust thinking about folders, subfolders and files, towards the more intuitive approach Capacities offers with objects in a network. These are two of the three core pillars Capacities is based on. We suggest making good use of tags, which are a flexible structure for categorizing and organizing your objects.
Whilst this might be a change from what you’re used to working with, we are confident that you will find our alternative intuitive and sustainable in the long term.
We hope this article helped you consider if PARA could be right for you in Capacities. It just works. Try it for yourself!
