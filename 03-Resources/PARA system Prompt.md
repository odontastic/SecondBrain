Brief description: I’ll explain how to sort your notes into the PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives), give a quick decision guide and examples, and offer a simple step-by-step workflow you can apply. Paste your notes and I’ll map them for you.
* PARA definitions (quick):
 * Projects — short-term, outcome-focused things you’re actively working on (e.g., “Launch podcast,” “Q3 marketing campaign”).
 * Areas — ongoing responsibilities or standards you must maintain (e.g., “Finance,” “Health,” “Product quality”).
 * Resources — topic-based reference or learning material you might consult later (e.g., “JavaScript tutorials,” “Vacation ideas”).
 * Archives — inactive or completed items you want to keep for records (e.g., finished projects, old receipts, past meeting notes).
* Quick decision checklist (use in this order):
 * Is there a defined outcome and steps to complete it soon? → Project.
 * Is it an ongoing responsibility without a completion date? → Area.
 * Is it reference, notes for future use, or research? → Resource.
 * Is it finished/inactive and kept only for history? → Archive.
* Examples of common note types and where they go:
 * Meeting notes for an active deliverable → Project (or linked to a Project).
 * Meeting notes that relate to team processes or standards → Area.
 * Course notes, how-tos, research papers → Resource.
 * Receipts, completed invoices, closed contracts → Archive.
 * Ideas or raw brainstorms not currently actionable → Resource (or Project if you decide to act).
 * To-do list for monthly bills or ongoing routines → Area (maintain responsibility).
 * Sprint planning or task lists with a deadline → Project.
* Practical step-by-step triage workflow:
 * Step 1 — Gather: put all loose notes in an “inbox” folder or tag.
 * Step 2 — Scan each note quickly and apply the decision checklist above.
 * Step 3 — Move to PARA folders or tag accordingly (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive).
 * Step 4 — For notes that touch multiple categories, keep a single copy in the best primary place and link/ tag them to others.
 * Step 5 — Name consistently: [Type] – [Short Description] – [Date/Status] (e.g., “Project – Podcast Launch – Q4 2025”).
 * Step 6 — Review cadence: weekly triage for Projects, monthly check for Areas, quarterly cleanup for Resources/Archive.
* Handling messy or overlapping notes:
 * If a note contains both project tasks and reference info, split it: task part → Project, reference part → Resource (or link between them).
 * Use tags or backlinks for context rather than duplicating content.
 * If unsure, default to Resource (easier to promote to Project later than to resurrect Archive).
* Naming, folder & tagging tips:
 * Keep top-level names simple: Projects/, Areas/, Resources/, Archive/.
 * Subfolders by area or project name (e.g., Projects/Website Redesign/).
 * Use tags for status (e.g., #active, #on-hold, #reference, #urgent).
 * Include dates on completed items before moving to Archive.
* Automation and tools tips:
 * Use search and saved filters (e.g., notes with “deadline” or “due” keywords) to find Project candidates.
 * Templates for common project notes (meeting note, task list, brief) speed triage.
 * If your note app supports linked notes, create an “Active Projects” dashboard that pulls items tagged #active.
* Maintenance routine (minimal):
 * Weekly: triage inbox and update active Projects.
 * Monthly: quick sweep of Areas (standards, recurring responsibilities).
 * Quarterly: prune Resources, move stale items to Archive.
Optional context: If you paste or attach your notes (or a sample list), I’ll categorize each item into Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archive and suggest folder names and tags you can apply.
