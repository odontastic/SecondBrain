## YOUR HAIR PROFILE

**Age:** 58 years old  
**Ethnicity:** Chinese (Asian hair characteristics)  
**Natural hair:** Originally black, now mostly white/gray  
**Starting point:** Permanent brown-black (Revlon Colorsilk #20)  
**Goal:** Streaky, textured, medium-dark silver-gray with dimension  
**Skin tone:** Tanned, medium tone (warm/golden undertones)

**Hair Characteristics:**
- High melanin concentration (typical of Asian hair)
- Strong red/gold underlying pigment when lightened
- **CRITICAL: Extremely porous in white/virgin areas**
- Moderate porosity in previously colored areas
- Quick to grab cool tones (ash, violet, purple)

---

## ESSENTIAL VOCABULARY & CONCEPTS

### **Hair Color Levels (1-10 Scale)**
- **1-3**: Black to darkest brown
- **4-5**: Medium brown (your starting brown-black)
- **6**: Dark blonde (brassy orange when lifted from dark)
- **7**: Medium blonde (where most of your hair settled)
- **8**: Light blonde (your lighter sections)
- **9-10**: Very pale yellow to white (needed for bright silver)

### **Tone Letters**
- **A/AA**: Ash (blue-based, neutralizes orange/brass)
- **V/VV**: Violet (purple-based, neutralizes yellow only)
- **N**: Natural/neutral
- **G**: Gold (warm)

### **Developer Volumes**
- **10-volume** (3% peroxide): Deposit only, gentle toning, minimal lift
- **20-volume** (6% peroxide): Lifts 1-2 levels, standard permanent color
- **30-40 volume**: Not recommended for your hair (too aggressive)

### **Key Concepts**

**Porosity:**
- How easily hair absorbs and holds pigment
- **Low porosity**: Tight cuticle, resists color (rare in damaged/white hair)
- **High porosity**: Open cuticle, grabs color aggressively (YOUR white sections)
- **Your hair has TWO porosity zones** (critical discovery)

**Underlying Pigment:**
- The natural warm tone revealed when lightening dark hair
- Asian hair: Strong red-orange at level 6, yellow-gold at level 7-8
- Must be neutralized with opposite color (blue/ash) to achieve cool tones

**Color Wheel Opposites:**
- Blue neutralizes orange
- Purple/violet neutralizes yellow
- Orange neutralizes blue (creates green if not balanced)

**Deposit vs. Lift:**
- **Deposit**: Adding color pigment to hair (toners, demi-permanent with low volume)
- **Lift**: Lightening natural pigment (bleach, high-lift color with high volume)
- **Your 7AA with 10-vol**: Primarily deposited, minimal lift

**Oxidative vs. Direct Dye:**
- **Oxidative** (permanent): Requires developer, penetrates cortex, permanent
- **Direct dye** (semi-permanent): No developer, sits on cuticle, temporary

## YOUR COMPLETE PRODUCT INVENTORY

### **What You Have On Hand**

#### **Currently Useful:**
1. **AgeBeautiful 7AA** (Dark Double Ash)
   - Level 7, double ash (very cool)
   - Permanent color
   - Mix with 10-vol developer
   - **Best for:** Neutralizing brass on levels 6-7
   - **Your result:** Over-deposited on white areas (too porous)

2. **Ion Brights Violet Gray** (Semi-Permanent)
   - Direct dye, no developer needed
   - Very pigmented purple-gray
   - **Best for:** Final silver toning (heavily diluted)
   - **Your hair needs:** 1:4 to 1:8 dilution ratio
   - **NOT USED YET** (waiting for right time)

   - Used successfully to remove blue/teal over-deposits
   - Keep for future corrections

4. **10-Volume Developer**
   - For mixing with permanent colors
   - Gentle deposit, minimal lift

#### **Set Aside (Not Recommended for Current Goal):**
1. **Ion Platinum Lace** (Permanent high-lift toner)
   - For level 9-10 bases only
   - **Don't use on your level 6-7 hair**
   - Save for: Future root touch-ups on white regrowth only

2. **Manic Panic Blue Steel & Dark Star**
   - **DO NOT USE** for gray goal
   - Would add more blue (opposite of what you need)
   - Save for: Creative color projects unrelated to this

3. **Color Remover** (from Sally Beauty)
   - Only removes permanent oxidative dye
   - **Won't remove toners or deposited pigment**
   - Already used, no need for more

4. **Powder Lightener**
   - Already used, no more lifting needed
   - **Do not use again** (damage risk)

---

## THE CHEMICAL PROCESS TIMELINE (WHAT YOU DID)

### **Your Journey:**

**Step 1: Color Removal**
- Used Sally Beauty color remover
- Removed permanent brown-black dye
- Hair still dark but artificial pigment shrunk

**Step 2: Lightening**
- Used powder lightener + 20-volume developer
- Lifted to levels 6-8 (uneven)
- Created brassy orange (level 6) on top
- Lighter blonde (level 7-8) on mid-lengths and bottom

**Step 3: Ash Toning (First Attempt)**
- Applied AgeBeautiful 7AA + 10-vol developer
- Processed evenly across all areas (mistake - didn't account for porosity zones)
- **Result:** Blue cast indoors, green in bright light (over-toned)

**Step 4: Blue Removal**
- 3x clarifying shampoo washes
- Successfully removed excess blue
- **Result:** Revealed green undertone (blue removed but yellow still present)

**Step 5: Purple Shampoo Treatment**
- Applied for 20 minutes to neutralize green/yellow
- Processed too long on white areas
- **Result:** Teal on porous white sections (over-deposit)

**Step 6: Teal Removal**
- Multiple clarifying washes
- Reduced but not eliminated teal
- **Current state:** Slight teal fading, gold tips visible, dimensional gray overall

**Total timeline:** Approximately 1-2 weeks  
**Total chemical processes:** 3 (remover, lightener, permanent toner)

## KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### **Critical Discoveries About YOUR Hair:**

#### **1. Two-Zone Porosity (Most Important Finding)**

**ZONE 1: Previously Colored/Lightened Areas**
- **Location:** Top, mid-lengths (where you had brown-black dye)
- **Levels:** 6-7 (dark to medium blonde)
- **Porosity:** Moderate
- **Behavior:** Accepts toner normally, holds color well
- **Treatment:** Standard dilution and processing time

**ZONE 2: White/Virgin Hair Areas**
- **Location:** Root tips, sides, back lower quarter (naturally white)
- **Levels:** 9-10 (very pale to white)
- **Porosity:** EXTREMELY HIGH (critical - acts like a sponge)
- **Behavior:** Grabs pigment aggressively and quickly
- **Treatment:** Needs heavy dilution, short time, or avoidance

**Why this matters:**
- Every product over-deposited on Zone 2
- 7AA: Too much blue on white areas
- Purple shampoo: Turned white areas teal
- **Future applications MUST treat zones differently**

---

#### **2. Cool Tones Deposit Aggressively on Your Hair**

**Pattern observed:**
- Ash tones (blue-based) = Over-deposit easily
- Violet tones (purple-based) = Over-deposit easily
- Warm tones = Under-represented in your results

**Why:** Your white hair has no underlying warmth to neutralize cool pigments, so they sit full-strength on the hair.

**Lesson:** Always start with more dilution than recommended, especially on light/white areas.

---

#### **3. Asian Hair Characteristics in Action**

**Underlying warm pigments:**
- Level 6: Red-orange (very strong)
- Level 7: Yellow-orange
- Level 8: Yellow-gold

**These appeared when lifting and when ash faded from tips.**

**Challenge:** Strong warm undertones require aggressive cool toners, but your porous white sections can't handle them.

**Solution:** Selective application - different strength for different areas.

---

#### **4. Processing Time Critical for Porous Hair**

**Standard timing doesn't work:**
- White areas process in 5-10 minutes
- Colored areas need 20-30 minutes
- Applying same time to all = uneven results

**Your proven timing:**
- **Darker areas (6-7):** 25-35 minutes
- **Light areas (8):** 10-15 minutes maximum
- **White areas (9-10):** 5 minutes or skip entirely

---

#### **5. "Many Colors" = Successful Dimensional Gray**

**What felt like failure:**
- Multiple tones visible
- Blue, green, teal, gold, white all present
- Looked "busy" or unfinished

**Reality:**
- This IS textured, dimensional gray
- Natural gray hair has variation
- Flat one-tone gray looks artificial
- Your result matches your goal once settled

**Mindset shift needed:** Accept variation as feature, not bug.

---

#### **6. Clarifying Shampoo Is Your Best Friend**

**Proven most effective for:**
- Removing over-deposited ash pigment
- Fading semi-permanent toners
- Reducing unwanted cool tones
- Gentler than chemical color removers

**Your success rate:** 70-80% pigment removal in 2-3 washes

**Protocol that worked:**
- 3 consecutive washes
- Hot water (opens cuticle)
- Vigorous massage 5+ minutes per wash
- Focus on problem areas

---

#### **7. Color Remover vs. Toner Removal**

**What you learned:**
- **Color remover** (what you used initially): Only removes permanent oxidative dye
- **Does NOT remove:** Toners, demi-permanent deposits, semi-permanent direct dyes
- **For your over-toning issues:** Clarifying shampoo worked better than color remover would have

---

#### **8. Purple Shampoo Power (Use With Caution)**

**Proven effective BUT:**
- 20 minutes was too long for your porous white areas
- Created teal over-deposit
- Needs selective application

**Correct protocol for YOUR hair:**
- Apply to darker areas only (avoid white)
- Maximum 5-10 minutes on any area
- Or heavily dilute for white sections (1:1 with regular shampoo)

---

## YOUR HAIR'S UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS

### **Strengths:**
✅ Accepts ash tones well (neutralizes brass effectively)  
✅ White sections create natural dimension  
✅ Holds color in colored areas  
✅ Responds to clarifying treatments (easy correction)  
✅ Natural texture supports "streaky" look  

### **Challenges:**
⚠️ Extremely porous white sections (biggest challenge)  
⚠️ Strong warm undertones when lifted  
⚠️ Uneven porosity requires zone-specific treatment  
⚠️ Over-grabs cool pigments quickly  
⚠️ Tips fade faster (oldest, most damaged hair)  

### **Optimal Approach for Future:**
- **Two-zone application** (different formulas or timing)
- **Heavy dilution** on white areas
- **Conservative processing time** (check early and often)
- **Maintenance-based** rather than correction-based

---

## PROVEN FORMULAS & RATIOS

### **Formula 1: Brass Neutralization (7AA Application)**

**What it does:** Neutralizes orange/brass at levels 6-7

**ZONE 1 Mix (Darker areas - Top, crown):**
```
- 1 oz AgeBeautiful 7AA
- 1 oz 10-volume developer
- Ratio: 1:1
- Mix thoroughly in non-metallic bowl
```

**Application:**
- Apply to brassy orange areas first (level 6-7)
- Work quickly and thoroughly
- Process: 30-35 minutes
- Check at 20 minutes

**ZONE 2 Treatment (White areas - Roots, sides, back):**
```
Option A: Skip entirely and apply in last 5 minutes only
Option B: Dilute the formula
- 1 oz prepared 7AA mix (from above)
- 1 oz clear conditioner or clear gloss
- Ratio: 1:1 dilution
- Apply for 10 minutes maximum
```

**Expected result:**
- Darker areas: Neutral ash blonde/brown (no orange)
- White areas: Slight ash tone without over-deposit

---

### **Formula 2: Silver/Gray Toning (Ion Violet Gray)**

**What it does:** Deposits silver-gray color on neutral base

**NEVER USED YET - For future Session 2 (when ready)**

**ZONE 1 Mix (Previously colored areas):**
```
- 1 part Ion Brights Violet Gray
- 3-4 parts white conditioner
- Ratio: 1:3 or 1:4
- Mix until smooth purple-gray color
```

**ZONE 2 Mix (White/virgin areas):**
```
- 1 part Ion Brights Violet Gray
- 6-8 parts white conditioner
- Ratio: 1:6 to 1:8 (much more diluted)
- Should be very pale lavender-gray
```

**Application:**
- On damp (not wet), clean hair
- Apply Zone 1 mix to darker areas first
- Process 10-15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes
- Apply Zone 2 mix to white areas in LAST 5 minutes
- Or apply Zone 2 mix separately with shorter time
- Rinse with cool water when desired tone reached

**CRITICAL:** Your hair proved it grabs pigment fast. Start conservative.

---

### **Formula 3: Purple Shampoo Treatment (Correction)**

**What it does:** Neutralizes yellow, maintains gray tone

**For Darker Areas (Safe):**
```
- Pure purple/silver shampoo
- Apply to damp hair
- Process: 5-10 minutes maximum
- Focus on areas with yellow/green cast
```

**For White Areas (Requires caution):**
```
Option A: Avoid entirely
Option B: Dilute first
- 1 part purple shampoo
- 1 part regular shampoo
- Process: 3-5 minutes MAXIMUM
- Watch closely for teal development
```

**Frequency:** Once per week maximum, only on areas that show yellow

---

### **Formula 4: Clarifying Removal (Over-Tone Correction)**

**What it does:** Removes excess deposited pigment

**Standard Protocol:**
```
- Clarifying or sulfate shampoo (undiluted)
- Hot water (as hot as comfortable)
- Apply directly to problem areas
- Massage vigorously 5+ minutes
- Rinse and repeat 2-3 times
- Follow with deep conditioning
```

**Enhanced Protocol (For stubborn deposits):**
```
- 2 tbsp clarifying shampoo
- 2 tbsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp warm water
- Mix to paste consistency
- Apply to problem areas only
- Massage 3-5 minutes
- Let sit 5 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly
- MUST deep condition after (baking soda is drying)
```

---

### **Formula 5: Vitamin C Treatment (Moderate Pigment Removal)**

**What it does:** Oxidizes and removes deposited color through acidic action

**Recipe:**
```
- 15-20 Vitamin C tablets (1000mg), crushed to powder
- 3 tbsp clarifying shampoo
- 2 tbsp warm water
- 1 tsp baking soda (optional, boosts effectiveness)
- Mix to thick paste
```

**Application:**
- Apply to DRY hair (more effective)
- Focus on areas with unwanted tone
- Massage thoroughly
- Cover with plastic cap
- Wrap with warm towel (not direct heat)
- Process 45-60 minutes
- Check every 15 minutes
- Should see tinted water/foam if working

**After-care:**
- Rinse thoroughly
- Shampoo once
- Deep condition 20+ minutes (critical)

**Effectiveness:** 40-70% pigment removal  
**Safety:** Very safe, can repeat after 48 hours  
**Best for:** Blue, green, purple over-deposits

---

## COMPLETE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

### **CURRENT PHASE: Recovery & Settling (Weeks 1-4)**

**Goal:** Let hair stabilize, let colors blend, allow teal to fade naturally

**Week 1-2: Active Recovery**

**Daily:**
- Gentle sulfate-free shampoo + conditioner
- Let teal fade naturally with washing
- No corrective treatments

**2-3x per week:**
- Deep conditioning treatment (20+ minutes)
- Focus on hair health, not color

**Weekly:**
- Progress photos in natural light
- Assess how colors are blending

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ No purple shampoo
- ❌ No clarifying shampoo (unless teal very obvious)
- ❌ No toning treatments
- ❌ No additional color of any kind

---

**Week 3-4: Light Maintenance Begins**

**Daily:**
- Continue gentle shampoo/conditioner

**1x per week:**
- Purple/silver shampoo (SELECTIVE application)
  - Apply ONLY to mid-lengths (avoid white areas and tips)
  - Process 5 minutes maximum
  - Prevents yellow from returning

**2x per week:**
- Deep conditioning

**Weekly assessment:**
- Is teal completely gone? (Should be by week 3)
- Are colors blending into dimensional gray?
- Are you happy with overall appearance?

---

### **PHASE 2: Established Maintenance (Week 5+)**

**Goal:** Maintain dimensional gray, prevent yellowing, keep hair healthy

**Weekly Routine:**

**Day 1 (Start of week):**
- Purple/silver shampoo (selective application, 5 min)
- Focus on areas that tend toward yellow
- Avoid white sections

**Day 3-4:**
- Regular sulfate-free shampoo + conditioner

**Day 6-7:**
- Regular shampoo
- Deep conditioning treatment

**Every 2-4 weeks:**
- Protein treatment (strengthens hair structure)
- Examples: Aphogee, DIY gelatin treatment, Olaplex

**Monthly assessment:**
- Hair health check
- Tone evaluation
- Decide if touch-up needed

---

### **PHASE 3: Touch-Up Schedule (Every 6-12 weeks)**

**When to touch up:**
- Significant yellow/brass returning (purple shampoo not controlling it)
- New white growth creating too much contrast
- Warm tones at tips becoming distracting
- Overall gray fading to light blonde

**OPTION A: Maintenance Toning (Preferred)**
- Very diluted Ion Violet Gray (1:6 ratio)
- Apply to areas that need refreshing only
- 10 minutes maximum
- Avoids full re-processing

**OPTION B: Targeted Ash Application**
- Diluted 7AA on any new brassy areas only
- Spot treatment, not full head
- 15 minutes maximum

**OPTION C: Professional Touch-Up**
- If DIY becomes too complex
- Colorist can assess and adjust
- Cost: $50-150 depending on area

**After touch-up:**
- Deep condition immediately
- Resume maintenance schedule
- Give hair 1 week rest before any adjustments

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **Problem: Too Blue/Purple (Over-Toned)**

**Cause:**
- Too much ash or violet pigment deposited
- Processed too long
- Not diluted enough for porosity level

**Solution:**
1. **Clarifying shampoo** - 2-3 consecutive washes
2. **Hot oil treatment** - Helps pull pigment
3. **Wait 48 hours** - Repeat if needed
4. **If stubborn** - Vitamin C treatment

**Prevention:**
- Heavily dilute for white areas
- Process white areas for shorter time
- Check every 5 minutes during processing

---

### **Problem: Green Cast (Blue + Yellow)**

**Cause:**
- Ash pigment present but not enough to fully neutralize yellow
- Common when blue fades and yellow shows through

**Solution:**
1. **Purple shampoo treatment** - 10-15 minutes on green areas
2. **Suppresses yellow** - Green disappears when yellow neutralized
3. **Maintain** - Use purple shampoo 1x/week to prevent return

**Prevention:**
- Ensure adequate ash coverage during initial toning
- Don't over-remove blue (leaves yellow exposed)
- Maintain with purple shampoo regularly

---

### **Problem: Teal/Aqua Tone (Purple on White)**

**Cause:**
- Purple shampoo or violet toner over-deposited on porous white hair
- Processed too long on areas with no underlying warmth

**Solution:**
1. **Clarifying shampoo** - Multiple washes (2-3x)
2. **Baking soda scrub** - If clarifying alone doesn't work
3. **Time** - Fades with regular washing over 3-5 days

**Prevention:**
- Avoid purple shampoo on white areas entirely
- Or heavily dilute (1:1 with regular shampoo)
- Process white areas maximum 3-5 minutes
- Apply white areas LAST or skip them

---

### **Problem: Gold/Yellow at Tips**

**Cause:**
- Tips are oldest, most porous hair
- Ash tone fades fastest from tips
- Reveals underlying warm pigment

**Solution:**
1. **Accept as natural dimension** (Recommended)
2. **IF bothersome**: Light purple shampoo treatment on tips only
3. **Spot-tone** - Very diluted toner on tips specifically

**Prevention:**
- This is normal and will recur (tips always fade first)
- Not worth constant correction
- Adds warmth and prevents flat appearance
- Consider it part of dimensional look

---

### **Problem: Brassy Orange Returning**

**Cause:**
- Ash tone fading from previously colored areas
- Yellow-orange undertone showing through
- Happens as color washes out over time

**Solution:**
1. **Purple shampoo maintenance** - May not be enough for orange
2. **Diluted 7AA touch-up** - Spot-treat brassy areas only
3. **Professional toner refresh** - If widespread

**Prevention:**
- Regular purple/silver shampoo use
- Touch up every 6-8 weeks before brass becomes obvious
- Use color-safe, sulfate-free shampoo to extend toner life

---

### **Problem: Uneven/Patchy Color**

**Cause:**
- Different porosity zones processed differently
- Uneven application
- Some areas grabbed more pigment than others

**Solution:**
1. **Identify darker vs lighter spots**
2. **Spot-treat lighter areas** - Apply more pigment to under-toned areas only
3. **Dilute darker areas** - Use clarifying shampoo on over-toned spots
4. **Even out gradually** - Don't try to fix all at once

**Prevention:**
- Two-zone application from the start
- Apply darker areas first, lighter areas last
- Check processing every 5 minutes
- Stop when even enough (perfect uniformity unrealistic)

---

### **Problem: Hair Feels Damaged/Dry**

**Cause:**
- Multiple chemical processes
- Cuticle damage from lightening
- Porosity increased

**Solution:**
1. **STOP all chemical processes immediately**
2. **Deep condition** - 2-3x per week minimum
3. **Protein treatment** - Rebuilds hair structure
4. **Trim if needed** - Remove severely damaged ends
5. **Wait 4-8 weeks** - Before any more color

**Prevention:**
- Space chemical processes minimum 2 weeks apart
- Use bond-building treatments (Olaplex)
- Deep condition between processes
- Don't exceed 3-4 chemical processes in short period

---

## WHAT TO DO & WHAT NOT TO DO

### **✅ ALWAYS DO:**

1. **Strand test first**
   - Test any new formula on hidden section
   - Assess color and processing time
   - Prevents full-head disasters

2. **Patch test for allergies**
   - 48 hours before using new product
   - Behind ear or inner elbow
   - Even if you've used similar products

3. **Work in sections**
   - Divide hair into 4-6 sections
   - Ensures even application
   - Makes checking easier

4. **Check processing frequently**
   - Every 5 minutes when toning
   - Rub small area to check color underneath
   - Stop when desired tone reached (don't wait for full time)

5. **Apply darker/brassy areas FIRST**
   - They need most processing time
   - Apply white/light areas LAST
   - This accounts for different porosity

6. **Deep condition after chemical processes**
   - Minimum 20 minutes
   - Helps close cuticle
   - Restores moisture

7. **Take progress photos**
   - In natural light
   - Same location/lighting each time
   - Helps track what's working

8. **Keep detailed notes**
   - What you used
   - How long you processed
   - What worked/didn't work
   - Ratios and timing

9. **Use cool/lukewarm water for rinsing**
   - Hot water opens cuticle (fades color faster)
   - Cool water seals cuticle
   - Helps color last longer

10. **Wait between chemical processes**
    - Minimum 48 hours, preferably 1-2 weeks
    - Allows hair to recover
    - Prevents cumulative damage

---

### **❌ NEVER DO:**

1. **Don't apply one formula to all areas**
   - Your hair has different porosity zones
   - Requires different treatment
   - Causes uneven results

2. **Don't leave toner on "until time is up"**
   - Check constantly
   - Stop when color looks good
   - Over-processing is main cause of problems

3. **Don't use heat during chemical processing**
   - No blow dryers, heating caps on bleach/color
   - Accelerates unpredictably
   - Risk of burns and over-processing
   - Body heat under plastic cap is sufficient

4. **Don't mix permanent and semi-permanent**
   - Different pH levels
   - Chemical incompatibility
   - Unpredictable results

5. **Don't use color remover on toners**
   - Wrong tool for the job
   - Won't work on deposited pigment
   - Only works on permanent oxidative dye
   - Use clarifying shampoo instead

6. **Don't apply purple shampoo for 20+ minutes on white hair**
   - Your experience: Created teal
   - White hair has no warmth to neutralize purple
   - 3-5 minutes maximum, or avoid entirely

7. **Don't use Manic Panic for gray goals**
   - Direct dye, very intense
   - Blue Steel/Dark Star add MORE blue
   - Wrong for neutralizing or covering problems
   - Save for creative color only

8. **Don't chase perfect uniformity**
   - Flat one-tone gray looks artificial
   - Dimensional variation is the goal
   - Leads to over-processing cycle
   - Accept natural variation

9. **Don't use Ion Platinum Lace on orange hair**
   - Toner for level 9-10 only
   - Won't lift orange to pale yellow
   - Creates muddy results
   - Use 7AA for brass neutralization instead

10. **Don't do more than 3-4 chemical processes in short period**
    - Your hair: Remover, lightener, permanent color = limit reached
    - More = significant damage risk
    - Breakage, loss of elasticity
    - Let hair recover 4-8 weeks minimum

11. **Don't ignore your hair's feedback**
    - Gummy texture = over-processed
    - Snaps when stretched = damaged
    - Extremely dry = needs protein/moisture
    - Listen and adjust

12. **Don't panic and add more color to fix color**
    - Usually makes it worse
    - Remove first, then re-assess
    - Clarifying shampoo is safer than more chemicals
