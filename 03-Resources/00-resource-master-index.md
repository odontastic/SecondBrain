## Resource Organization Principles

### Accessibility
- **High Priority**: Frequently used resources (frontmost)
- **Medium Priority**: Occasionally referenced materials
- **Low Priority**: Archive or long-term storage items

### Metadata Standards
- All resources include complete frontmatter
- Source attribution for external content
- Usage tracking and last accessed dates
- Quality ratings and verification status

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review high-usage resources
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive resource audit
- **Annually**: Archive outdated materials

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding Resources
1. Assess if content is truly useful for future use
2. Apply appropriate metadata and categorization
3. Follow naming conventions
4. Link to relevant areas and projects
5. Update resource index files

### Resource Quality
- **Verified**: Source confirmed and content validated
- **Needs Review**: Requires verification or updates
- **Outdated**: Superseded by newer resources
- **Active**: Currently relevant and useful
