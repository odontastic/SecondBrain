## REVISED GAME PLAN: LASER FOCUS

### YOUR TWO PRIORITIES (Nothing Else Matters)

### **THURSDAY (Her Return)**

**The Moment She Arrives**:
1. **Put down whatever you're doing immediately**
2. **Go to her** (don't wait for her to come find you)
3. **Make eye contact**
4. **Say**: "Welcome home. How was the trip?" (genuine interest)
5. **LISTEN** without planning your response
6. **Help with bags/settling in** (active support)
7. **Stay present for 30 minutes minimum** (no phone, no laptop, no checking out)

**When the First Sigh Comes** (it will):
- Choose a Sigh Playbook response
- Deliver it calmly
- Don't over-explain

**When the First Criticism Comes** (it probably will):
- Take a breath
- "You're right. The pressure on you is immense."
- Do NOT defend or explain yet
- Stay in the room

## THE PEP TALK YOU NEED

**You have 3.5 days. That's enough.**

You're not trying to be perfect. You're trying to show her: **"I see you coming home. I prepared for you. You matter to me."**

The clean house is evidence you were thinking about her while she was gone.

The First-Aid Kit phrases are evidence you're trying to change the pattern.

Your presence when she walks in is evidence you're choosing connection over avoidance.

**She might still criticize. She might still be stressed. That's okay.**

Your job isn't to make her happy instantly. Your job is to **stay in the room** and show her **she's not alone**.
